should exist a being of human face and mien, who so far
surpasses brute beasts in savageness as to have most shame-
fully robbed of the light of day those to whom he owes it
that he ever looked upon the pleasant light around us; for
the bearing and rearing of offspring, ay, and Nature herself
teaches wild beasts to be at peace with one another.

64. Not so very many years ago, according to all accounts,
a certain Titus Caelius of Tarracina, a well-known man,
after dining retired to rest in the same chamber as his two
young sons, and was found murdered in the morning. As
no slave or free man was found to whom any suspicion

father, even though they are said to have done the deed in
obedjence to the behests and the oracles of the immortal
gods, how, Ι say, they are for all that chased by Furies
and not suffered to find any abidjng-place, because they
could not even do their duty without guilt‘? Thus stands
the matter, gentlemen of the J ury. There is in a father’s
and a mother's blood a great power, a strong tie of kinship‚
and a high sanctity: and if any stain is contracted there-
from, it cannot be washed out, nay more, it penetrates so
