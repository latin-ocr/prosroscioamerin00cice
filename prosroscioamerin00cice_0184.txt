6 CICERO

15. Sextus Roscius, my client's father, was a burgher of
Ameria who in birth, reputation‚ and wealth was facile
princeps in the country round, to say nothing of his native
town, and moreover he enjoyed the advantage of the in-
fluence and guest-friendship given to him by men of the
highest rank. For he was on terms not only of guest-
friendship‚ but even of intimate and familiar acquaintance
with the Metelli, the Servilii and the Scipios—houses that
Ι name, as is fair, to acknowledge their good repute and
their distinction: and so this is the only one of all his

be enemies were being taken prisoners in every district, he
was constantly at Rome, and daily appeared in the forum
and before the public eye, so that he seemed rather to be
rejoicing in the success of the aristocracy than to fear that
any disaster would befall himself as a result of that success.

17. He had a long-standing feud with the two Roscii of
Ameria, one of whom Ι see sitting in the prosecutors'
benches, the other Ι am told is in possession of three of
his estates. And had his caution with regard to this feud
been as great as his fear he would be alive to-day. Nor
indeed was his fear groundless, seeing that those two Titi
Roscii, the surname of one of whom is Capito, while the
one yonder, who is present, is called Magnus, are men of
the following character,—one of them is regarded as an
