PRO snx. Roscm, ἐξ 144.-148. 53

Roscius has become yours, do you not make it plain that
you are afraid 01 a contingency, which you more than the
rest 01 1110 world ought not to fear, that the children 01
the proscribed may have their fathers’ possessions restored
to them?

146. You do a wrong, Chrysogonus, 11 you rest more
confident hopes for the security 01 your purchase on my
client’s destruction than on the achievements 01 Lucius
Sulla. But 11 there is no reason why my client should be
visited with such a disastrous fate, 11 110 has given up to
you his all, saving only his 1110, and has not secretly kept
back 101· himself anything that belonged to his father, even
for a momento, in Heaven’s name, what is the meaning 01
your implacable relentlessness‘? What is the nature 01
your savage and brutal heart‘? What robber was ever so
abandoned, what pirate so barbarous, as to prefer to drag
off his plunder through gore when he might have his booty
intact without bloodshed?

147. Yon know that my client has no money, no reckless
daring, no power, that he has never planned anything
against your interests, and yet you attack a man whom
you cannot fear and ought not to hate, and who you
see has now nothing 1011 101· you to rob him of: unless
you think it is a shame that you see sitting clothed in 1110
court the man whom you drove from his inheritance naked
just as from a shipwreck; as 11 forsooth you did not know
that my client is being supported and clothed by Caeciliafflnqgssbs *2⁸²⁴*-
a lady who is universally respected, a lady who, though she ‘’³21⁹'‘OE
had a sire 01 high renown, uncles 01 glorious fame, and a
brother 01 great distinction, still, woman as she was, was
prompted by the manly spirit in her to take care to pay
back to them from her own glorious deeds distinctions in
no wise inferior to the honour she received from their high
position.

148. Do you think it is a shameful crime that he is
being energetically defended? Believe me, 11 111 return 101·
his father's hospitality and favours all my client's guest-
friends consented to aid him and dar-ed to defend him
without reserve, he would have a very abundant supply of
advocates ; but 11 everv one were to exact a vengeance 101·
