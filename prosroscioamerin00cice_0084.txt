21. quibus occidi patrem Sex. Roscii bono fuitt “to whom the
murder of Sextus Roscius’ father was an advantage.” quibus is
dative of indirect object accompanying the predicative dative bono,
the two forming a “double dative,’' lit. “to whom it was for an
advantage :’' occidi patrem Sex. Roscii is subject offuit, and patrem
Seae. Roscii is subject of occidi.

on 1, 4.

27. poscit: sc. in iudicium3 i.e. the people are eager to see them
stand their trial and suffer condign punishment for their crimea
relictus : ’‘superfluous’' as restat = “ is left.''

29. quae facta. sunt : the short relative clause expresses a simple
definition3 hence the verb is in the indicative instead of the sub·
junctive, although the clause is dependent on an accusative and
infinitive phrase.

31. quo facilius: quo (not ut) is the regular final conjunction
when the clause introduced by it contains a comparative adverb3
it is really a (neuter) ablative of the measure of difference.

Ch. V1.—-1. municeps : a burgess of a municipium or praefectura,
, possessing originally the civitas sine suffrayio, i.e. the private but
. not the public rights of Roman citizenship. After the Social WVar
· (91-88 Ro.) all municipia obtained full citizen rights and became
country towns of Roman citizens. Each municipium had local
independence, with magistrates and a Senate of its own. The
Senate of Ameria consisted of one hundred members, divided into
ten decuriae; hence the Senators were called decuriones. At their
head were the decem primi mentioned below (9, 11).

2. eum: not a preposition governing yenere, but an adverb,
corresponding totum in line 3; cum . . . tum = “both . . . and.'’
genere: ablative of respect. municipii: partitive genitive with
primus,

3. gratia. . . . hospitiis: ablatives of respect with florem, a
word expressing plenty. The tie of hospitium (guest-friendship)
was a very important feature of Roman life. Those connected by
this tie (which was hereditary) were received into one another’s
households and enjoye al i privileges possessed by members of
such households ; in fact the hospitium supplied the want of inns.
