XL„ ἓξ 116-118. ARGUMENT.-—To deceive one’s partner is con-
sidered, and riyhtly considered, as base α lhz'ny as to betray α trust.
But Capito cajoled, deserted, and betrayed nine honourable men. It
is in α life like his, ancl amid crimes like hie, that you will surely find
the crime with which, the present trial deals.

Ch. XL.—6. rem communicavit : “has entered into partnership.’'
Partnership (societas) belonged like mandatum to the consensual
contracts, and bona fides was in partnership, as in mandatum, the
leading principle.

7. per eius fidem: se. datam et non serratam, i. e. this partner has
pledged his word and broken his pledge.

9. tecti: “reserved.'⁷ ad: “towards,” “with reference to.''

11. qui: adverb, “how.’'

20. metuere non debuerunt: ‘⁶ were in duty bound not to fear.’'

23. parum: with cauti providique.

26. minatur: i.e. with his evidence.

tendency to join quis (= aliquis) closely to si.

36. quid tandem: sc. videtur vobis.

38. hie discipulus; Cicero here turns to Magnus, and by this
reference facilitates the transition to Magnus, who is dealt with in
the next chapter.

XLI„ §g 119-121. ARGoMENm-Wzy dict you, Titus Boscim, re-
fzcse‚without any yoocl reason, to yive up the two slaves to be examinecl ?
These slaves were upon the scene at the time of the murder; hence
your efforts to prevent their being] yiven up afforoled yood yrouncls for
suspicion.

Ch. XL1.——l. fidem : “ good faith,⁷’ ironical.

3. istis: i.e. ab aclrersarz'i83 but it is Magnus who is principally
referred to, since he was procurator of Chrysogonus, into whose
possession the slaves had come: moreover Cicero having exposed
the faithless character of Capito now desires to throw suspicion on
Ma nus.

the persons who made it.
