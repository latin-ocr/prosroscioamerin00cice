he had been guilty of a most dishonourable act; according-
ly there was instituted legal procedure dealing with breach
of trust, involving no less disgrace than that dealing with
theft, ,Ι suppose because in matters in which we cannot
engage⁵⁴⁶personally9the promise of our friends is substituted
in the place of 0111 performance, and the man who breaks
this promise assails a bulwark which belongs to all of us
in common, and, so far as in him lies, throws our social
life into confusion. For we cannot do everything by our-

confidence in his friend.

113. Is it not so? In matters of the smallest import-
ance, a man who has not attended to a trust must have a
most dishonouring sentence passed upon him, and in a
matter so serious—when the man, to whose care and keep-
ing were confidently entrusted the good name of the dead
and the fortunes of the living, has brought disgrace upon
the dead and destitution upon the living—shall he be
reckoned among honourable men, or, 1 should rather say,
among living citizens? In unimportant and private
