18 INTRODUO'HON.

The evidence of slaves was as a rule not admitted as
valid unless eh'cited under torture, and a slave could not,
except in certain special cases, give evidence against his
own master. We gather from the Pro Roscio that the
slaves of a person other than the defendant could not give
evidence unless the permission of their owner was sought
and obtained. When the master of a household was
murdered (as in the case of Roscius) the son who suc-
ceeded him as paterfamilias was permitted, as the avenger
of his father's death, to have the whole household of slaves
put to the torture. In the case of freemen the law forbade
the eliciting of evidence by toi-ture; the prosecutor could
by a formal demand (testimonii denuntiatio) compel them
to give evidence, but the witnesses for the defence were
not required to give evidence unless they chose to do so.

Penalties iuflicted by Standinq Commissious. The penal-
ties inflicted by the quaestiones perpetuae as or ganised by
Sulla were in some instances pecuniary. In case of the
g1aver crimes the usual punishment was either outlawry
(aquae et 191113 1111616110110) or disqualification for public
duties (iufamia). The consequence of a bill of outlawry
was that the condemned man went into voluntary exile,
f01 exile (ewsilium) was in itself never a penalty, but always
a means of escaping from a penalty. It was only in case
of the crime with which the Pro Roscio deaIs, viz.
parricidium, that the death penalty could be passed.

T.he Crime of Parricidium. In the days of the

longer employed' 111 this wide sense: it meant primarilyffi the

anyone to whom the murderer 1s bound by the ties of blood
