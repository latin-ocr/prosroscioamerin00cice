116 ’ ommno: pso Roscio. [cn. 1121.

10. dicerent . . . esset . . . putaret: these verbs depend on
vixerunt, the words talesque α populo Romano putantur being to a
certain extent parenthetical‚ and denoting the result arrived at by
the blameless mode of life of the homines nobilissimi. esset: the
subjunctive is hypothetical (in the apodosis of a conditional sen-
tence) as well as consecutive (“there would be no one . . .’'),
quidquid dicerent being protasis (quidquid = si quid). When the
apodosis of a conditional sentence referring to present or past time
is also consecutive, a periphrasis by means of the future participle
with fuerim is usually resorted to, instead of the imperfect or
pluperfect active ; so that here we might have expected futurus
suerit for esset. An hypothetical imperfect is, however, sometimes
found (as he1·e)‚-—-a pluperfect very rarely.

de cuperet: potential subjunctive. dum: = dummodo, “pro-
vi e that.

16. recusaris: the object rem can easily be supplied. cum
occiditur Sex. Roscius: “at the time when Sex. Roscius was

meaning “during the time that ’' is regularly used with the
present indicative.)

of suspiciosum est. oppugnari t = obsisti, hence followed by ne.

27. deliciarum . . . artium: genitives of quality. puerulos:
“ et slaves.''

ἓξ). operarios: with special reference to field-work, “farm-
labourers.'' ex: “fresh from.'' -

30. non est veri simile ut : veri simile is constructed with ut only
in negative or quasi-negative sentences.

XL11.‚§§ 122, 123. mmmmm—As reyards Chrysoqonus, I do
‘not suspect him of tlze murder, or of a desire to conceal it. But I do

say that the excessive influence of Ohrysoyonus is intolerabie, and
should be weakened.

Ch. XL11.—l. suine: “of his own ’² as opposed to that of the
Roscii.

2. non vult: = recusat. minime: referring to sui.

3. non in omnes arbitror omnia convenire: i.e. circumstances
alter cases; in this instance the circumstances are such that we
cannot regard Chrysogonus as implicated in the actual murder.

6. meministis . . . distribuisse: cf. Ch. 13. Memini is said to be
