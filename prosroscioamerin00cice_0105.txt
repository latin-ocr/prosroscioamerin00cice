crime.

Ch. m1.—l. sapientiam: accusative of exclamation, really the
object of some verb more or less vaguely understood. Here we
might understand videte, “ consider.”

2. rerum natura: “the natural world.’' cui: dative of indirect
object, with a verb of “taking away’'; ex above (line 2) has its
full sense of ‘⁶ out of.''

3. ademerint : subjunctive in causal relative clause. It may also
be regarded as subjunctive of reported definition.

4. necasset: consecutive subjunctive. unde = a quo 01· ex quo,
“from whom,'' a colloquial idiom. natus esset: subjunctive in a
clause dependent on the dependent subjunctive clause qui eum
necasset.

5. dicuntur: indicative, although the clause is grammatically
dependent on a subjunctive clause. The indicative is here used
because the clause merely defines, and the definition is not repre-
sented as having been present in the minds of the maiores.

6. scelus: “abomination ”; it is not used here for scelestus, as is
generally maintained.

7. attigissent: subjunctive in causal relative clause. immani-
oribus: predicative with uteremur ; “lest we might find the very
beasts made more savage.'' sic : with nudos, “ naked as they were.''
Some refer sic to cantum scelus, with the meaning “ since they were
so wicked''; but the separation in sense of sic from 'nudos is very
harsh.

8. deicere: sc. voluerunt.

11. reliquerint: subjunctive in consecutive relative clause3 cuius
= ut eius. quid. . . . tam commune: “what boon so universal.’'
Cicero in his Orator (Ch. 30,§ 107) quotes lines 11-17 of this chapter ;
he states that they were received with loud applause‚ and confesses
that even in his old age he still feels their fiery energy.

14. ut eorum ossa terra non tangat: the ancients believed that
the spirits of those who lay unhuried could not enter the next
world. Hence, if a man came upon an unhuried corpse‚ he threw
at least three handfuls of earth upon it; and this was considered
eqlllssvail'g'ffl'gg ῗίξίιξειᾶὲὲῂἰνθ of person judging: “ to the satisfaction
of men like these.’'

21. paratius: Cicero generally uses the adjective paratus with
venire ; here the adverb is used to correspond with diliqentius, which
is a loose expression for diliyencius meditatus, “having more care·
fullv thought the matter out.”

22 venisses: the subjunctive is jussive (“you ought to have
