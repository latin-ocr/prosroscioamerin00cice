70 ommno: PRO Roscm. [cn. 1.

29. plurimum: accusative denoting the extent of the action of
poggini'gnorare : here “ to disregard '' 3 its usual meaning is “ to be
lglgglassdeliebam ε “ Ι was in duty bound '' ; as usual, an historic tense
of debeo is constructed with a present infinitive. Debebam is au
almost certain conjecture for the reading of the MSS„ debeam.

11.‚ ἓξ 5-7. ARGUMENT.—'l'he ‘reason why so many eminent men
have been deterred from nndwtakiny this desence ‘rests with Chryso-
yonus; he has sew'zed the property of Sextus Roscius, and does not
think he will be able to keepsecure possession ofit unless the defendant
has been first yot out of the way.

[Consult the Index for Sulla, Chrysogonus]

eh. 11.-1. patronus t “ pleader,'' “ counsel‚’' to be distinguished
from the advocatus, who was merely an adviser. The accused
usually had four patroni, but in this trial he had only one.

3. possem: consecutive subjunctive in a relative clause, lit.
“ being a man of such a kind that I could.”

4. defensus: sc. esset. utine: practically = τως uti is added to
balance uti in line 3, and to give a positive rather than a negative
effect to the clause.

6. sit: subjunctive in an indirect question.

7. impediat ε consecutive subjunctive.

8. capite et fortunis : the caput was properly the legal status or
personality of a Roman, and included the rights of citizenship and
of frcedom as well as the right to live. As a rule the quaestiones
could not inflict the death penalty, so that the highest deminutio
capitis possible would be loss of citizenship by voluntary exile.
Under the Cornelian law the ancient death penalty of the “ sack '’
was retained, but only where the accused confessed his guilt.
‘Thus it would seem that Roscius was fighting for his rights as a

citizen, not for his property (which was already lost, there being
no question of restitution); the addition of fortunis is merely due
to the fact that capnt et fortunae was a hackneyed expression : loss

, of property was a usual accompaniment of loss of status, but in this
case the meaning of fortunae is not to be pressed. See Introd., ἓ 8.

ζ’ 9. quod. adhuc vos ignorare: subject of mirum est ; quod, “ this
circumstance‚” is object of iynorare.

10. accusatoribus: there was only one recognised accuser,
Erucius; Cicero, in using the plural, wishes to emphasise the fact
that the part played by Erucius, a professional accuser of bad cha-
racter, was merely nominaL and that lie had been employed by
others. eius rei: were afraid of losing the property of the
murdered Roscius, and therefore made no mention of the fact that
it was in their hands.
