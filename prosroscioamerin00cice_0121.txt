9. ne palam res agatur: as would be the case if the envoys came
before Sulla.

10. sublata. sit : representing sublata erit of direct speech.

11. eapitis periculum ε see note on 2, 8. illum: sc. Chrysoyonum,
object of acuere, which is historio infinitive.

13. monere ut caveret: the sequence of the historic infinitive is
always historic.

15. depecisci ε “ to bargain for.”

17. postremo z ‘⁶ in short.’' isto . . . intercessore ι “ on his
becoming surety‚'' 01· “guaranteeing'’ that the venditio bonorum
would be annulled. Intercessor generally means a “mediator ’³ in
money matters. It is also used (in the sense of “ protester'’) of the
tribunus plebis in the exercise of his veto.

18. fide . . . perfidia: “word . . . broken word.'’

20. testimonium iis denuntiare ε “ to subpoena them.’' The
commanding by sumxnons (denuntiatio) of the presence of witnesses
was a right possessed by the prosecutor, not by the defendant. The
evidence for the defence was purely voluntary. Had his client
possessed the right of denuntiatio, Cicero would merely have said
“if I produce them as witnesses.'' In civil cases compulsory
evidence was barred altogether.

22. rem mandatam: “a trust.’' The mandatum was an agree-
ment in virtue of which a man undertook to manage any business
for another. The person who gave the charge was called man-
dator3 he who undertook the charge was called mandatorius
(or qui recipit mandatum). The mandatum belonged to the class
of contracts known as “consensual‚” i.e. those entered into by a
simple agreement between the partieS. In case of non-fulfilment of
the obligation‚ the mandatory was liable to an actio mandati, “ trial
for breach of trust‚'’ in which indemnification could be claimed
either on the ground of premeditated fraud (dotus malus, in line 22
malitiosius) or want of due care (neyliyentia, in line 23 περίἰῃεηίὶῑιε),
since the mandatory had in the agreement promised “diligent
attention.’' malitiosius: used instead of the positive for the sake
of uniformity (as neqliyentius follows). Dolus matus did not admit
of degrees, as did neyliyentia.

25. non minus turpe quam furti : since a condemnation in either
caslelenctiailed the penalty of infamia or disqualifioation for various

u ie uties.
P 27. vicaria . . . supponitur: “is substituted in place of,’' vicaria
being predicative.'’

37. quod te putas sustinere posse t sc. and yet you want to shake
off the burden as being too heavy to be borne. quod minime videtur
grave iis, qui mininie ipsi leves sunt z i. e. it is only those who have
the most strength of character that find such burdens easy to be
borne; hence the whole business only serves to betray the worth-
lessness of your character. The sense, however, is far from being
satisfactory, and the conjecture minime leve videtur (yrave being
regarded as a gloss for minime leve) is a very likely one.
