[Consult the Index for Volaterrae]

Ch. V11.—1. hic z “ my client,” so in line 2, and hunc in line 8.

2. 811111 1118 . . . Romae esset : these parenthetical statements
serve to strengthen the plea of an alibi set up by the accused, and
to leave the impression on the minds of the jury that Titus Roscius
Magnus was at Rome on the day of the murder, though no proof of
the allegation was forthcoming. iste: i.e. T. Roscius Magnus.

5. ad balneas Pallacinas: near the Circus Flaminius, a little to
the N.W. of the Capitol.

6. spero . . . non esse : spero generally takes the future infinitive,
but the present is also found. ex hoc ipso: i.e. the absence from
Rome of Sextus and the presence at Rome of Magnus ; hoc is
neuter.

8. hunc . . . iudicatote: “in that case you may set my client
down as ''; the future imperative is used regularly in laws and
treaties, since it refers 10 time following, or to 501118 particular case
that may occur. Some consider that here, and in other places
where it appears in this speech, 1118 future imperative has a permis-
sive sense, ‘⁶ Ι give you leave to set my client down as.''

9. culpae: may be either (objective) genitive 01· dative (of the
indirect object). .

lO. Ameriam: accusative of goal of motion with nuntiat, here
constructed like a verb of motion ; no preposition is used, as
Ameria is the name of a town. nuntiat : the object is occisum esse
Roscium, to be supplied from the ablative of attendant circumstances
occiso Roscio (line 9).

12. domum z 588 note on Ameriam, line 10. post horam primam
noctis: “an hour after nightfall.’' The Romans divided the day
into 12 hours, counting from sunrise to sunset, and the night into
12 hours, counting from sunset to sunrise ; the honrs of the day and
night varied in length according to the season of the year.

14. nocturnis: since Cicero is drawing attention to the speed of
the messenger, the addition of this word shows that the hours were

, ,ι short and the season therefore summer. sex et quinquaginta milia
² ²* passuum: 513 English miles ; passuum is partitive genitive.
