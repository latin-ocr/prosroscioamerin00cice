like that of the Metelli (intimately connected with Sulla) would not
be included in the lists of the proscribed.

6. quas . . . familias: strictly speaking only the Metelli and
the Scipiones were familiae, the former belonging to the plebeian
Caecilia 9em, the latter to the patrician Cornelia yen33 the Servilii
were a patrician qens, not a familia. But in Cicero’s time there
was no clear line of demarcation between a qens and a familia, and
this fact was reflected in common speech.

7. honestatis . . . gratia nomino: see note on 2, 13.

8. itaque: “and so.''

9. domestici ε “ belonging to liis own family '⁹ (domus).

ll. hic: “ he, of whom I am speaking‚'' i.e. the elder Roscius.

12. fuisset: subjunctive in a causal clause, which expresses in
general terms the reason for Roscius’ action in the special case
(liam hoc tumultu, etc). hoc tumultu proximo : tumultus was
strictly speaking any sudden outbreak or ‘⁶ disturbance '³ in or near
Italy which caused panic and confusion in Rome. Here the refer-
ence is to the Civil War between Sulla and the democratic party
under the younger Marius (83-82 Rc.) ; see Introd.‚ ξ 2.

15. opera . . . studio . . . auctoritate: “activity . . . inclina-
tion . . . influence on others.’'

16. propter quos ε “ to whom he owed it that.''

17. numerabatur: indicative in a clause dependent on an accu-
sative and infinitive phrase3 the subjunctive would here be more
regular, but Cicero wishes to emphasise the actual fact rather than
to give the thought of Roscius.

18. proscriberentur: see Introd.‚ §2

19. caperentur ε = comprehenderentur.

20. frequens: adverbial = frequenter, “ constantly.”

21. magis : with exsultare. ut . . . videretur: “so that he
appeared,'' subjunctive in consecutive clause.

23. calamitatis : partitive genitive with quid. inimicitiae :
“famis” For the facts see Introd, ξ 3.

24. in accusatorum subselliis z since Roscius supported the prose-
cution the evidence he wished to give would necessarily be biassed.
For subsellia see 5, 17, note.

26. possidere audio z see Introd.‚ ἓ 3.

27. neque . . . iniuria: “and not without grounds.” The
ablative iniuria (the converse of iure) is practically an adverb, and so
does not need cum or an epithet, as the ordinary ablative of manner
does.

29. Capitoni : a name is often attracted to agree in case with the
dative substantive or pronoun (here alleri) denoting the person to
whom the name is given.

30. eius modi: “ of the following character.” palmarum :
genitive of quality with yladiator.

31. vetus et nobilis gladiator: secondary predicate. nobilis: a
standing epithet of those who excel in any art or accomplishment.

32. lanistam . . . tiro: when gladiators, after winning many
