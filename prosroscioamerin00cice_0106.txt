XXVII„ ἓξ 73-75. Auamma-I now ask you, Erucius, since you
cannot alleye any motiue, by what means did Sex. Roscius kin his
father? Was it by slaves or by sreemen ? I f by the latter, were they
from Ameria or from Rome, and by whose means did he bribe them ? I
pass over the point that it is a city life, not a country life, that pro·
duces atrocities of this description.

Ch. XXVII.—l. esto ε “ Good !” Cicero here passes from the dis—
cussion of motives to that of meane, and inquires, not why Roscius
should have killed his father, but how Roscius could have killed his
father.

2. vicisse debeo ε lit. “ I am in duty bound to have won‚’' i.e. “ I
ought to be considered as the winner.'' The perfect infinitive is
often used to describe an action as completed and ready, where in
English the present is normally used. de meo iure decedam : “I
will withdraw from my ri ghtful claim.''

6. meo loco: i.e. ἠτιηο cum meus sit dicendi locus. Cicero con-
siders the present portion of Erucius' case to be so weak that he
offers to allow the altercatio or eroes-examination, which generally
came at the close of the counsel’s speech, to take place during the

and the following questions, downto quantum dedit in line 17,
Cicero collects together in the form of a dilemma all the possible
cases. ipsum: sc. percussisse.

lO. Romae 11011 fuit t z respondes eum Romae non fuisse.

ll. †si per liberos: not in the MSS. but required by the sense,
as one member of the statement (i.e. the major premiss) of the
dilemma must be mentioned here; the other member (per servos)
follows in 28, 13.

12. Ameria: ablative of origin, a form of the ablativo of “ place
whence. ’'

13. unde ε “from what source.'’

14. multis annis: ablative expressing the amount of time from,
or since, when something has not happened.

15. qui: an old ablative of manner ; “How did he confer with
them ‘2²' (i.e. whether personally or by means of agents ?). Supply

17. unde . . . dedit: = a quo dedit, “on whom did he draw?’'
The Romans seldom made payments in cash ; as a rule they paid, as
in modern times, by a draft on a banker (amentarius) with whom
