PRO snx. ROSCIO, ἐξ 39—45. 15

not mad and the son was not a villain, the father had no
motive for hatred‚ the son 110 motive for crime.

42. ‘⁶ Ι don’t know,’' he sayS‚ “what the motive for the
hatred was : but Ι am sure that the hatred existed, because
formerly, when 110 had two sons, he always wanted the
other, who is now dead, to be with him, while he banished
this one to his country estates.'’ The same difficulty that
Erucius met with in his false and frivolous accusation 1

and dismissa] to the country? You see, Erucius, how far
removed your argument is from the true facts 01 the case.
What fathers customarily do, you find fault with as an
innovation3 what is done out 01 kindness you allege to
have been done from hatred; the privilege the father gave
to his son to show his respect for him, you say was meant
to punish him.

45. And you do not fail to understand this, no, but you
