PRO SEX. Roscm, ἐξ 73-77. 27

75. While dealing with this topic, Ι pass over a point
which might have served as a strong argument in establish-
ing my client’s innocence z—that in country habits, in
meagre diet, in a rough and uncivilized mode of life,
crimes of the sort you describe do not generally find their
origin. Just as you would not be able to find every plant
or tree on every soil, so every crime does not arise in every
kind of life. In the metropolis wauton extravagance is
produced; from such extravagance rapacity necessarily
arises3 from rapacity reckless daring breaks out; thence
spring all sorts of iniquities and crimes ; but this country
life, which you call bom-ish, is the teacher of economy,
industry, and fair dealing.

'7 6. But Ι pass over these points: Ι ask you this ques-
tion: Who were the men by whose agency that man, who,
as you yourself admit, never was much among men, could
have got so heinous a crime committed with such secrecy,
and that though he was not on the spot? There are many
false charges, gentlemen‚ which can be brought so as to
arouse suspicion3 but in the case of these allegations if
any ground for suspicion shall be found, Ι will admit that
there are grounds for blame. Sextus Roscius was murdered
at Rome, when his son was in the lands of Ameria: he
sent a letter, I suppose, to some murderer‚ —he who knew no
one at Rome. “He summoned some one.'’ Whom and
when? ‘⁴ He sent a messenger.'' Whom and to whom?
‘⁶ He persuaded some one by a bribe, by his influence‚ by
the hopes and promises he held out.'’ N one of these
charges can be even invented, and yet we have here a trial
for parricide.

7 7. It remains that he must have committed the crime
by means of slaver. Ye gods immortal! what a lamentable
and disastrous thing it is that Sextus Roscius is not allowed
to adopt a course which in the case of a serious charge like
this is generally the refuge of an innocent man, Ι mean to
offer his slaves for examination by torture. You, who
accuse my client, have all his slaves in your possession3
not one young slave to attend on his daily needs has been
left to Sextus Roscius from his numerous household. I
now call upon you, Publius Scipio, on you, M. Metellus: it
