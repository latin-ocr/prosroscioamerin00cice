to make an impression on the minds of the jury.

‘ forbearance. ''

19. cum huie eidem quaestioni iudex praeesses: i.e. as iudex
quaestionis in place of the praetors, since there were not enough
praetors to suffice for the presidency of all the courts. If the oeca-
sion here referred to was before the Lex Cornelia of 81 Β. 0. (as seems
likely from 5, 5), Fannius would probably have been president of a
special commission established by the people (cp. populo Roman05
for the trial of some particular murder case, since there seems to
have been no permanent quaestio inter sicarios before the Lex Cornelia
of 81 B.C. But if, as is improbable (see next note), the reference is
to a time after the passing of the Lex Cornelia of 81 Β.Ο., Fannius
must have presided as ordinary iudex quaestionis in the murder
court established by Sulla. See Introd„ ἕ 7.
