for such a crime? If you were to accuse my client even
before the purchasers of the property, and if Chrysogonus
were to preside over that court, you ought nevertheless to
have come with more careful preparation. Is it that you
fail to see 1ξο nature of the case, or rather the character of
the judges . ‹

73. The case is one of parricide, a crime which cannot
be taken on one’s shoulders without many motives; while
the judges are men of superior wisdom, who know that no
man can commit even the smallest crime without a mo-
tive. Very good: you can’t bring forward a motive: well,
although I ought to have won my case at once, yet 1 will
withdraw from my rightful claim, and, relying on my
client's innocence, Ι will yield to you in this case what Ι
· would not yield in another: I do not ask you why Sextus
Roscius murdered his father: I ask how he murdered him.
Therefore Ι ask you, Gaius Erucius, How? And I shall
adopt this method of p1·oceeding with you. I shall give
you permission to answer or contradict me during my time
for speaking, or even of asking me questions, if you wish.

¹74. How did he commit the murder? Did he strike the
blow himself, or did he give him over to others to murder 9
If you say that he struck the blow himself, he was not at
Rome. If you say that he used others as tools to do the
deed, I ask: W÷=re they slaves or free 1110119 If free men,
what 1110119 Μο11 from the spot at Ameria or murderers
from here at the metropolis? If from Ameria, who are
they‘? Why are they not named? If from Rome, from
what source did Roscius come to know them, a man who
has not visited Rome for many years, and was never there
more than three days 9 Where did he meet them 9 How
did he consult with them? How did he persuade them?
He bribed them. To whom did he give it? Through
whom did he give 119 011 whom did he draw, and how
much did he give? Is it not by such traces as these that
the source of a crime can generally be arrived 019 And at
the same time be sure you reflect 011 1110 manner in which
you delineated my client's lifez—that he was savage and
boorish ; that he never entered into conversation with any
one; that he never stayed in a town.
