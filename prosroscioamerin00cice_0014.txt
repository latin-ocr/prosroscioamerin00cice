The legislation of Sulla as dictator (81-79 110.) may be
studied in any text-book of Roman history. The merely
partisan measures, which had for their object the restora-
tion of senatorial rule, were foredoomed to faiIure, since
it was not in oligarchy but in monarchy that the empire
could find its ultimate salvation. The aristocracy had
done its work, and all attempts to bolster up its failing
powers were vain. But some of Sulla’s reforms were use-
ful and therefore permanent; and it is with that portion
of these permanent reforms which dealt with criminal law
and procedure that we are concerned as the Setting of this

trial. (See ξ 7.)

often of gain. Sulla, who was devoted to pleasure‚ kept
about his person a number of freedmen‚ one of the most
powerful of whom was the Chrysogonus who figures in this
case (ξ 3). These men had gained enormous wealth
through the proscriptions3 but being voluptuous and ex-
travagant‚ they were not satisfied with their gains, and
hired assassins to waylay and murder rich men, whose names
they fraudulently inserted in the proscription lists, and whose
confiscated property they bought for a mere song. The
present trial provides an example of this lawless cupidity.
