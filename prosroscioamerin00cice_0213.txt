first to bring news to Ameria? Mallius Glaucia, whom Ι
have named before now, your client and a member 01 your
household. What had he 01 311 men to do with bringing
news 01 3 matter which concerned you less than anybody
in the world, 11 you had before this entered upon no plan
to secure his death and obtain his property, and had not
joined with any man in a conspiracy for crime and plunder?
“ Mallius brought the tidings without being asked.’' What
concern was it of his, Ι ask? What? was it a mere matter
01 chance that after coming to Ameria without having this
purpose in view he was the first to announce what he had
heard at Rome? For what purpose had he come to Ameria ⁵?
“I cannot guess,” he says. I will now bring the matter
to a point at which there is no need of guessing. On what
principle did he bring news to Capito first? When there
were at Ameria, Sextus Roscius' home, his wife, and his
children, when there were his numerous kith and kin who
were on very good terms with him, 011 what principle did
it happen that that client 01 yours, the messenger of your
own crime, brought news to Titus Roscius Capito before
aH others P

97. Ηο was murdered while returning from dinner: it
was not yet dawn when the fact was known at Ameria.
What means this unprecedented pace, this speed and
hurry‘? Ι do not ask who struck the blow 3 you have
nothing to fear, Glaucia3 Ι don’t shake you out in case you
had any weapon, Ι don’t ,search you, it’s no business 01
1111110, Ι think: when Ι discover who planned the murder
Ι don't care by whose hand the blow was struck. This is
the only thing Ι take as certain, which indeed is granted
me by your evident guilt and the convincing proot' brought
forward. Where and from whom did Glaucia hear of it?
How did he learn 01 it so quickly? Suppose he heard it
at once. What motive constrained him to hurry over so
long a journey in a single night P What was the pressing
necessity that compelled him (11 110 did make the journey
to Ameria unasked) to set out from Rome at so late an
hour, to rest during no part 01 the night? Must we ask
101· proof or make conjectures even in the case 01 facts so
plain as these?
