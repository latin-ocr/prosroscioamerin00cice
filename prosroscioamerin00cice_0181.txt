1110 snx. ROSCIO, ἐξ 4—8. 3

individual of the day in our state, avers that he bought for
two thousand sesterces from the illustrious and gallant
Lucius Sulla, whom Ι mention with all respect. This
Chrysogonus, gentlemen 01 1110 J ury, makes the following
demand, that, since he has seized upon the extensive and
famous property 01 another man without having any just
claim to it, and since the 1110 01 Sextus Roscius seems
to be an obstacle and impediment to that property, you
should blot out all suspicion and remove 011 1001 110111 1113
thoughts: while my client is living he does not think he
0011 keep possession 01 my innocent client’s extensive and
wealthy inheritance3 but he hopes that, 01101 110 1103 00011
condemned and 0031 0111, 110 0011 waste and squander 111
11010113 excess what 110 1103 got by villainy. He asks you
to take from his side this thorn that pricks and galls him
day and night, so that you may 00111033 yourselves his
abettors in obtaining his iH-gotten gains.

7. Ι1 you think his demand is 1011 0οᾶ 1101101110010,
gentlemen, Ι 011 the other hand submit to you a short
request‚ and one that, as Ι 11013101 myself, is a little 101101.
First, Ι ask Chrysogonus to be content with our money and
our property, and not to ask 101 0111 1110’3 blood as well3
next, Ι ask you, gentlemen‚ to withstand the wicked pur-
pose 01 reckless men and relieve the desperate disti-ess 01
1110 innocent, and in the case 01 Sextus Roscius to repel
the danger which threatens all 01 us.

8. But 11 grounds 101 011 accusation or suspicion 01 guilt
or, in a word, any 1001 even 01 1110 slightest importance be
discovered to make them seem to have been guided by at
least something in bringing this accusation, in fine, 11
you come upon any motive except the booty Ι spoke 01,
we do not protest against the 1110 01 Sextus Roscius
being surrendered to their caprice; but 11 1110 only object
in view is to prevent their lacking anything to whom
nothing is enough, 11 1110 object 01 0111 00111031 to-day be
that the condemnation 01 Sextus Roscius should come to
crown that rich and famous booty, is not this perhaps
the most dishonomable among the many dishonourable

· aspects 01 the 0030, 11101 you have been regarded as men

well adapted to allow their securing by means 01 your votes
