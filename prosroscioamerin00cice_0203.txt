one would do the deed. He is said to have acted cleverly
in not making any enactment about a crime which had
not been committed before, lest he might appear not so
much to prevent as to suggest it. How much more wisely
our ancestors acted! As they knew that there is nothing
so sacred that recklessness does not at times lay violent
hands upon it, they invented a unique punishment for
parricides, in order to deter from the crime by the enormity
of the punishment those whom nature unaided had not
been able to keep to their duty: they ordained that such
men should be sewn into a sack while still living, and cast
into running water.

71. A truly unique example of wisdom, gentlemen! Do
they not seem to have taken, to have torn from the uni-

72. Yet indeed what is so common as breath to living
men, earth to dead men, sea to those who are tossed in
the waves, the shore to those who have been cast ashore?
They live while they can do so without being able to
breathe the air from the firmament. 'I'hey die so that the
earth cannot cover their bones3 they are tossed in the
waves so that they can never be touched by them 3 finally
they are thrown ashore so that they cannot rest even on
the rocks when dead. Do you think you can prove a
charge involving such a crime, a crime for which so un-
exampled a penalty 1138 been fixed? do you think you 0311
establish it, Erucius, to the satisfaction of good men and
true like those, if you do not even bring forward a motivo
