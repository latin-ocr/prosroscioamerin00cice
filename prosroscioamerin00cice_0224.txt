44 CICERO

about him, it is not against their master, since you state
that you are their masters. “ They are with Chrysogonus.''
So Ι believe: Chrysogonus is so delighted with their
literary ability and town-bred refinement that he desires
these men to associate with his own effeminate slaves
equipped with all the charms of luxury and skill, the pick
of many a well-trained household—these men who are little
more than labourerS, trained by a country-bred master of
a household at Ameria.

121. This is not so, you may be certain, gentlemen: it
is not probable that Chrysogonus took a fancy to their
literary ability and culture, it is not probable that he knew
their energy and loyalty in the business of his household:
there is something that is hidden, something that shines
forth to view the more clearly, the more eagerly they
smother and conceal it.

122. What is it then? Is it in order to hide his own guilt
that Chrysogonus refuses to allow them to be examined‘?
By no means, gentlemen: all things are not expedient for
all men. In Chrysogonus' case, so far as Ι am concerned,
I have no suspicion of that sort3 and this is not the first
time that it has occurred to me to make this statement.
You remember that Ι made the following division of my
case at the commencement. The first heading was “ The
charge‚” and the task of substantiating this with argu-
ments I left to Erucius ; the second “Recklessness‚” and
this 1ὃ10 has been assigned to the Roscii. All the crime,
gunt, and bloodshed in the case will necessarily be the
peculiar sphere of the Roscii; we also state that the exces—
sive influence and power of Chrysogonus is to us an obstacle
and an offence which is absolutely intolerable, while you,
since you have received the power, ought not merely to
weaken but to avenge it.

123. This is my opinion: he who would consent to an
examination of those who, it is admitted, were present
when the murder was committed, is desirous that the truth
should be discovered; he who refuses assuredly makes a
confession of his crime by his mere act, though 110 does not
dare to do 80 by word of mouth. Ι said at the beginning,
gentlemen‚ that I did not wish to say more about the guilt
