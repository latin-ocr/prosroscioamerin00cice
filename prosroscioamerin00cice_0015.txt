§3. circumstances of the Case. Sextus Roscius, the
father of the aecused, was a wealthy and distinguished
citizen of Ameria (modern Amelia), a town in Umbria
near the junction of the Tiber and the Nar, about fifty
miles to the north of Rome. In the civil wars he had
been on the side of the nobility, for he was bound by
ties of mutual hospitality and personal friendship to such
famous famih'es as the Metelli and the Servilii. He
entrusted the management of his thirteen farms to his
only surviving son, the defendant Sextus, who was at the
time of the trial a man of forty, while he himself lived
principally at Rome among his aristocratia guest-friends.

The relations between father and son do not seem to
have been exactly unfriendly, since the younger Roscius
not only managed the property, but was allowed the usu-
fruct of some of the farms during his father’s life-time.
Thus his position was an honourable one3 but “home-
keeping youth have ever homely wits,'’ and there could be
little in common between the country-bred son, who
shunned society and the life of Rome, and was probably
of boorish manners, and the fashionable father, to whom
the amenities of society and the refinements of town life
were indispensable.

Titus Roscius Capito and Titus Roscius Magnus were
kinsmen and fellow-oitizens of the elder Roscius; they
were also his enemies‚ the cause of the feud being some
ancient quai-rel about property. Capito was a senator or
decurio of Ameria, and carried out the Sullan proscriptions
111 that neighbourhood; Magnus seems to have been an
adventurer, who lived at Rome and was ready to under-
take anything which would put money in his purse. Both
Capito and Magnus had attached themselves as clients to
Sulla's favourite, the freedman Chrysogonus In the late
summer of 81 Β.0., two or three months after the official
closing (on June lst) of the proscription and confisca-
tion lists, Sextus Roscius the elder was attaeked and
murdered near the Pallacine baths, on his return one
evening from an entertainment. We are completely in
'the dark as to whether the deed was committed by one or
more personS, whether by assassins or as the result of a
