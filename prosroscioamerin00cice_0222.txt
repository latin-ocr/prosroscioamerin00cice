himself Ρ Moreover, we must punish most severely those
offences against which it is most difficult to be forearmed.
We can be reserved in our dealings with strangers3 but our
intimate friends must necessarily have a clearer view of
much of our conduct: yet how can we be on our guard
against a partner? Why, even if we fear him we break

long series of scandalous deeds, that you will find this crime
too with which the present trial is concerned.

118. For surely you ought to put the question to your-
selves in this way: where you see many rapacious, many
reckless‚ many abandoned, many treacherous acts, there,
amidst that array of scandals‚ you may believe some guilty
offence too lies concealed. Though indeed this act is far
