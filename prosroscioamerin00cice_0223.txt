PRO snx. Roscm, ἐξ 117-120, 43

this crime any one of the former that may be doubted can
be clearly proved. What follows, Ι ask, gentlemen of the
Jury‘? Do you think that trainer has now entirely given
up the cut-throat's trade, or that his pupil there is one whit
behind his master in skill? They are well matched in
greed‚ equal in wickedness, in shamelessness the same, in
recklessness twin-brothers.

119. For indeed now that you have become acquainted
with the master’s good faith, Ι would have you know of
the pupil’s fairness. Ι have already stated over and over
again that two slaves were demanded from the prosecutor
for examination by torture. You, Titus Roscius, always
refused. Ι put these questions to you: Were those who
made the demand unworthy to obtain it‘? Oould not the
man for whom they demanded it move you to pity? Did
the demand itself seem to you to be unfair Ρ The demand
was made by men of the highest reputation and character
in our state, whose names Ι have already mentioned; men
whose way of life was such, and who are so esteemed by
the Roman people, that it was impossible for them to make
any statement which every one would not regard as fair
and reasonable ; and they made their demand in behalf of
a most pitiable and unfortunate gentleman who, if need
were, would actually desire to give himself up for torture,
provided an inquiry were being made about his father's
death ; (120) moreover, such was the nature of the demand
that was made of you, that it made no difference whether
you refused that demand or confessed your crime.

Since this is so, Ι ask you why you have refused it.
They were upon the scene at the time of Sextus Roscius’
murder. So far as Ι am concerned, I neither accuse nor
exculpate the slaves: the fact that I see you making every
effort to prevent their being given up for examination
rouses my suspicion3 while from the fact that they are
treated with such regard by yourselves‚ it of course neces-
sarily follows that they know something which, if they
stated it, would bring ruin on you. “ It is unjust that
slaves should be examined for evidence against their
masters.” But they are not examined against you: for
Sextus Roscius is the accused3 when they are examinet]
