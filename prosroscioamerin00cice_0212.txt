of your confederacy3 and contrast whatever you say in
reply with my defence: in this way can Sextus Roscius'
case be most easily contrasted with yours.

94. You will say, ‘⁴ What follows if Ι was continually at
Rome ⁴? '’ Ι shall reply, “ But I was not there at all.'' ‘⁶ I
confess that Ι was a dealer in property, but so were many
others.’' “But I, as you yourself allege, was a country
farmer.'’ ‘⁴ It does not follow that because Ι did join
myself to a band of assassins Ι am an assassin.'’ “ But
surely Ι, who was not even acquainted with any assassins,

might seem not so much one concerning their plunder as
about my client’s crime, to think that you should have
claimed for yourself the role you have claimed of busying
yourself in this court and sitting with the prosecutor! By
this conduct you will get nothing except the privilege of
having your recklessness and brazen effrontery lmown to
all mankind.
