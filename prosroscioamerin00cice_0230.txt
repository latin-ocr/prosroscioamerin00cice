belonged to that party. But if their endeavours are
directed to this end, and 11 arms were taken up with this
object, then men 01 the basest sort should enrich them-
selves with other people's monies and seize upon each
individual's property, and 11 0110 may not, I do not say
prevent it by an open act, but even censure it by word 01
mouth, then, Ι aver, the Roman people was not reinvigo-
rated and restored to power but subdued and crushed.
138. But the facts 01 the case are far different3 none 01
these suppositions are true, gentlemen: so far from in-
flicting damage on the cause of the aristocraey, 11 you
withstand those men you will even add distinction to it.
For in fact those who wish to censure the present state 01
affairs, complain 01 Chry sogonus’ great power; those who
wish to praise it, declare that they have not made any
concession to him. And now there is no excuse 101· any
one being so senseless and shameless as to say, “I only
wish it had been permissible: I would have said this.”
You may say it. ‘⁴ Ι would have done this.’' You may do

it: no oue prevents you. “I would have voted for this
decree.'’ Vote 101· it, only do so straightforwardly: then
all will applaud. “I would have given this judgment.’'

Every one will praise you 11 you give judgment in a straight-
forward and appropriate manner.

gencies 01 the time, unlimited power was vested in the
hands 01 0110 man: but after he had created magistrates
and established his laws‚ every one had his particular
official duty and power restored to him. And if those who
have recovered it like to retain it, they may maintain it
for ever3 but if they engage in or appi-ove 01 these acts 01
murder and spoliation‚ these excesses 01 profuse and pro-
digal extravagance, I am unwilling to say anything too
severe against them, even by way 01 a presage 01 its coming
to pass, Ι only venture this one remark. Our high and
mighty nobility, unless they are watchful and patriotio
and brave and merciful, will be compelled to give up their
distinctions to men who have these qualities.

140. Wherefore let them now at last cease from stating
that a man has spoken slanderously 11 110 has spoken truly
