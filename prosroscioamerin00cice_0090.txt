82 emeno: PRO Roscro. [cn. 11.

19. ita loqui homines: best regarded as accusative and infinitive,
co-ordinate with huic patronos defuturos (line 21), verbum esse
facturum neminem (line 23), and sore (line 24). These represent in
oratio obliqua the reflexions of the Roscii, and give the motives
which induced them to bring the charge of parricide against Sextus.
The scope of the reference of ita loqui homines is confined to quod
iudicia . . . adductus esset. Some take loqui as historic infinitive,
but the words huic autem . . . defensus esset, as is proved by 11, 13,
form no part of what ‘⁶ people were saying '³ ; and the transition to
the actual thoughts of the Roscii (in huic autem . . . ) would be
vegg‘agglggggssglgvglgmzzdk z in order that the public confidence in
the judicial courts, which had been shaken owing to their long
cessation, might be again restored.

21. adductus esset: represents the future-perfect indicative of
direct speech.

22. gratiam: “influence.'’
