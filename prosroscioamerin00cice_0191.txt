pao snx. ROSCIO, ἐξ 32—38. 13

committed ‘m the case of Scaevola3 is the crime more
endurable because it is being committed by Chrysogonus?
Why, in the name of Heaven, what need of defence is there
in this case ⁸? What topic needs the ability of an advocate
or wants to any considerable degree the eloquence of an
orator‘? Let me set forth the whole case, gentlemen, and
when Ι have set it out before your eyes let me examine it
carefully. In this way you will ascertain without any
difficulty the point on which the whole case turns, the
topics on which Ι must speak‚ and the considerations by
which you ought to be guided.

35. So far as Ι can see there are three obstacles in
Sextus Roscius’ way to-day t—the charge brought by his
opponents, their reckless daring, and their powerful influ-

37. Sextus Roscius is charged with having murdered his
father. Ye deathless gods, a damnable and atrocious
deed! a deed so foul that all crimes seem to be embraced
by this one sin. For if, according to that striking saying
of philosophers‚ filial duty is often violated by a look,
what punishment shall be found severe enough for a man
who has brought death upon his father, for whom the laws
of gods and men irresistibly urged him to encounter death
itself, if the occasion should demand it‘?

38. In the case of this atrocious, foul, and unique sin, of
which examples are so rare that whenever it has been heard
of it is reckoned as something like a prodigy and portent,
which arguments, Ι ask, do yon, Graius Erucius, think an
