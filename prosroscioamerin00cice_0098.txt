90 ’ menno: PRO Roscm. [cn. xrx.

21. esset . . . posset: the reference is in this case not to “a man,''
but to Sex. Roscius; hence the change of tense. Esset is subjimc-
tive in a causal, posset in a consecutive, clause.

25. immo vero ε “ yes, indeed !'' contradicting the negative
assumption in the question.

26. audio ε “ that I can listen to ’² ; i.e. you are at last making an
assertion which calls for some notice.

27. illa z referring to what follows ; in contrast to nuuc dicis
aliquid.

29. quippe: “ of course not.”

30. veniret: subjunctive in causal relative clause3 qui = “inas-
much as he.'’ domum : accusative denoting the goal of motion, used
without a preposition with domus and rus as well as the names of
towns (cp. 7, 19). vocabat: sc, ad cenam.

32. revocaturus ε “in a position to return their invitation.''

XIX„ ἐξ 52-55. Aac UMENT.—Y ou say that the father was thinking]
ofdisiuherihuq his son. Not only are you unable to prove any bad
conduct οη the part of the son which might induce the father to dis-
inherit him, but you cannot even iuvent α probable motive for such αη
intention.

ablative of the standard οἱ comparison.

4. quaerere : infinitive used as accusative of direct object,
governed by mittere.

5. qui : ‘⁴ h0w‚'’ old ablative of qui, used as an adverb. te dicere

. oportebat: auxiliary verbs of duty (debeo, oportet), when used
in a past tense, themselves take the tense—sign in Latin, while the
infinitive used with them is always in the present tense ; in English
it is the infinitive that takes the tense-sign, while the auxiliary
remains unchanged—“ You ought to speak,'⁷ oportet te dicere ; “you
ought to have spoken,'’ oportebat te dicere.

6. erat : “would have been '² ; we nnght have expected esset, but
in hypothetical clauses the indicative of eum (with the gerundive, and
occasionally‚ as here, in other cases), possum, debeo, is commonly
used instead of the subjunctive.

7. argueret ε subjunctive in consecutive relative clause.

8. potuerit: the tense is here primary, though the main verb
(erat) is historic. When the potential subjunctive is used in a
dependent clause (as here in an indirect question), which would in
