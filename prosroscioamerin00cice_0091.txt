17. quoniam . . . semel: “when once.'’ quidem: adversative,
“ still.’' hercules : nominative 3 the full phrase is mehercules, which
is short for me Hercules adiuuet. Hercules here belongs really to the
main verbs succurram and subibo ; in colloquial language the speaker
often anticipates a word of asseveration.

20. dicere . . . dicere: infinitives used as subjects ok certum est
deliberat umque.

2l. tanta exsistet : “ will arise of such weight.''

22. vim mihi maiorem adhibere: “to exercise more influence
npon me '³ ; vim adhibere = vim adferre.

23. animo: ablative of description.

24. videat: subjunctive in dependence on the consecutive sub-
junctive possit. patrem meum . . . me . . . patrimonium meum:
Cicero here identifies himself with his client. The editors call
this an instance of the figure of speech known as prosopopoeia, or
‘⁵ personification ” (e. g. crudelitatis mater avaritia est, pater furor).
But there is, strictly speaking, no personification here, i.e. nothing
without life is here endowed with life.

29. condemnetis : “ get him condemned ’³ 3 condemno is often used
of the accuser who brings about a condemnation.

XII„ ἓξ 33-34. ARGUMENT.—This shameful accusation resembles
the case of Fimbria, who wouuded that „areat man Q. Scaevola, and
theu brouyht an action aqainst him because he had not quite succeeded

because he escaped you when you tried to murder him.

7. tamen: sc. etiamsi hic locus esset.

8. diem . . . dixit: in the trials before the people (the iudicia
populi which preceded the iudicia publica or quaestiones perpetuae)
prosecutions were undertaken by tribunes or other magistrates,
whose first step was, with the consent of the urban praetor, to name
a day (diem dicere) for the Comitia to meet for the hearing of the
case. Scaevolae z dative of “disadvantage.’'

9. posse vivere ε “ that he might possibly come off with his life.”
quid ε accusative of the extent of the action of the verb (accusaturus
esset), a variety of the accusative of the internal object ; “what
charge he meant to bring against that man‚” “what he was going
to accuse that man of.’'

ll. ut erat furiosus z “like a madman as he was '' ; for the indica-
tive see note on 5, 14.

12. telum . . . recepisset: an expression from the gladiatoria]
combats. When a gladiator was defeated he was forced to receive
the death-stroke without flinching when the spectators called out
‘⁶ recipe fem-umss'
