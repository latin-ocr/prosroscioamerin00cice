accuser ought to use ’.Ρ Ought he not to show that the man
who is called to answer the charge is characterized by a
unique recMessness, a savage disposition, and a brutish
nature3 that his life was given up to all kinds of vice
and villainy 3 and finally that his whole character was
shatteied and blasted in utter ruin. You have brought
none of these charges against Sextus Roscius, not even for
the sake of slanderous depreciation.

39. Sextus Roscius murdered his father. What sort of
a man is he‘? A depraved young man, a good-for-nothing
led on by other men Ῥ He is over forty years of age. A
veteran assassin, of course, a desperado of much experi-
ence in murder? But you have not heard this even
mentioned by the accuser. Then of course it was wauton
indulgence and a vast burden of debt and uncontrollable
avarice that drove him to this crime? From the charge of
wauton indulgence Erucius cleared him when he stated
that he was hardly ever present even at any dinner-party3
and he never owed any man anything; moreover‚ what
avarice can exist in the character of a man who, as 1118 very

spent his time in cultivating his land, a mode of life which
is far removed from avarice and closely connected with the
observance of moral duty?

40. What then suggested to Sextus Roscius the frenzied
act that you charge him with? “ His father,'’ quoth he,
“ did not like him.'' For what reason? Of course that
reason too must have been well grounded and weighty and
unmistakable: for as it is incredible that a father should
have been done to death by his son without numerous and
weighty reasons, so too it is improbable that a son should
have been strongly disliked by his parent without many
weighty and cogent reasons.

41. Let us return again then to the same point, and in-
quire what were these serious faults in an only son which
caused his father tn dislike him. But it 18 plain there was
not a single one. Therefore his father must have been
mad to hate without cause a son of his own begetting.
But he surely was the steadiest man in the world. Conse-
quently this conclusion is surely clear—if the father was
