reserve all that can be said, my speech nevertlieless will
fail to get abroad and make its way to the public in by
any means the same degree ; and lastly because no utter-
ance of the rest ean remain in obscurity owing to their ·
wide reputation and high standing, and owing to their age
and practical wisdom no allowance can be made for any
chance utterance. On the contrary if Ι say anything that

reliable bulwark, but that he might not be absolutely
abandoned. You may perhaps be asking what is the
nature of that fear among you and that panic terror, which
hinders 50 many excellent men from consenting to plead a
cause on behalf of another’s status and property as they
have been accustomed to clo. And it is not astonishing
that you do not know this, seeing that the prosecutors
have purposely avoided mentioning the real motive that
occasioned this trial.

6. What is that motive? It is the property of the
father of my client Sextus Roscius, which is worth six
millions of sesterces, and which Lucius Cornelius Chryso-
