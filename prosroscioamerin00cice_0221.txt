affairs, even carelessness is made a ground for a charge
of breach of trust and for a trial, owing to the dishonour
attaching to such conduct, because, in a reasonable course
of procedure, the neglect ought to be on the part of the
man who gave the commission, and not of the man
who accepted it: in a serious crime like this, which was
carried out and perpetrated publicly, when a man has, Ι

that you may understand that no crime can be imagined
whereby the prosecutor has not polluted himself. In
matters of small importance it is the depth of disgrace
to deceive a partner, and quite as disgraceful as the act
I spoke of just now; and quite rightly too, since a man
who has entered into partnership with another thinks that
