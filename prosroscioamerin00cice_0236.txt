lest measures should appear to have been taken by the
people’s council more severe than had been sanctioned by
the custom of our ancestors. But as for this prosoription,
which reaches their children and the cradles of their infant
babes, unless by this trial you cast it away and spurn it
from you, see, in Heaven’ s name, into what condition,
think y e, may the commonwealth come at last.

like your‚s would do well to heal especially those troubles
by which the commonwealth' is especially distressed. There
is not a man of you but knows that the Roman people,
who 111 days gone by were thought to be very merciful to

men suffer it no longer to walk abroad in this common-
wealth: for there is involved in it not only this evil, that
it has brutually destroyed hundreds of citizens, but it has
even taken away from the most merciful of men their

deed every hour, even the gentlest natures among us
through the constant presence of annoying trouble let
slip from our hearts every sentiment of human kindness.
