affair, would it not have been sufficient for them to receive
thanks? At most, supposing they were very liberally
treated, to have a small honorarium given them? Why
are three farms of such great value immediately given to
Capito? Why does our opponent Roscius own all the rest
in partnership with Chrysogonus? Is it not palpably
evident, gentlemen, that Chrysogonus gave up these as
spoils of war to the Roscii after examining their case?

109. Capito came as envoy to the camp among the ten
leading men. You can understand the whole of his conduct
in life, his disposition and character from this commission
alone: unless you are convinced, gentlemen, that there is
no moral duty, no legal sanction too sacred and inviolable

or rather his broken promises, that they were deceived—a
fact which you will be able to hear from their own lips, if
the prosecutor chooses to subpoena them—and thus carried
