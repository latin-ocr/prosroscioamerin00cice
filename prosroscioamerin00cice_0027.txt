Ι11110 parricide should be sewn up naked 111 a sack (culleus)
, and cast into a running stream, to be borne down to the
, sea. The poena cullei is vividly described by Cicero 111
the present speech (Oh. XXVI ).
, Τ11010 13 110 doubt that when Sulla embodied the 0111110 ot*
’ par ricidium 1n his Lem Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis, which
’ established the quaestio inter sicarios, before which Roscius
was tried, he retained the old death penalty of the “ sack,”
but it is probable that it could only be inflicted in cases
’ where the crime was specially heincus and where the accused
also made a confession of his guilt. Other cases were
punished by outlawry (aquae et iqnis interdictio) followed
as a necessary consequence by voluntary exile ; and this is
the penalty that would have been inflicted on Roscius had
110 been found guilty, since he had of course not confessed
κ the crime.

Since the arrest and imprisonment of an accused person,
with the object of preventing his escape, were practically
confined to cases in which the guilt was apparent or the
crime confessed‚ Roscius could have gone into voluntary
exile before or during his trial. His enemies no doubt
thought that he would do this‚—-in fact their main object
was to get him out of the way ; but he remained in Rome
because his honour was at stake: and even if he should be
condemned, the ultimate result, the penalty, would be the
same, since he would go into exile as a consequence of the
penalty of interdiction or outlawry.
