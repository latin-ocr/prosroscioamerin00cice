8 INTRODUCTION.

conflict. The younger Sextus seems to have neglected to
examine the two slaves who accompanied his father imme-
diately on their return from Rome, and may thus at first
have caused vague suspicion to attach to himself.

The first news 01 1110 murder was carried to Ameria, not
by one 01 these two slaves, but by one Mallius Glaucia, a
client 01 T. Roscius Magnus. This man announced the
tidings not, as one would naturally expect, to the son, but
to Roscius Capito; he arrived at Ameria at early dawn on
the morning after the murder, and thus seems to have
travelled all night for the express purpose 01 bringing the
news as quickly as possible, Within four days Chryso-
gonus, who was in Sulla's camp at Volaterrae in Etruria,
got word 01 1110 matter, evidently through the same source.
He was personally a stranger to the murdered man; all he
was interested 111 knowing was that a considerable estate
had been 1011.

Chrysogonus, ever on the look-out 101· fresh spofl, had
the name 01 1110 elder Roscius inserted 011 1110 proscription
lists (although these had been closed for some months),
and at a sham sale purchased the confiscated property at
a nominal price. A few days after, Magnus appeared
111 Ameria, drove Sextus Roscius from house and home,
and took possession, as the agent 01 Chrysogonus, 01 1011
01 1110 fai-ms, the other three being handed over to Capito.
The movable property was secretly disposed of or sold by
private auction.

These high-handed proceedings caused the utmost indig-
nation at Ameria. The local senate at once sent an embassy,
consisting 01 1110 1011 leading senators (among them Roscius
Ca pito) to the camp 01 Sulla, with the purpose 01 proving
thep loyalty of the elder Roscius, of getting his name ex-
punged from the proscription lists, and 01 reinstating his
son in his ancestral estate. But Chrysogonus, being
informed 01 1110 embassy by Capito, managed matteis so
that the envoys never got an interview with the Dictator.
He made them specious promises, and since Capito pledged
his word that these promises would be faithfully kept, 1110
ambassadors allowed themselves to be persuaded, and re-
turned home without effecting anything.
