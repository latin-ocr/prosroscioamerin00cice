25. servi. more scornful than liberti—Chrysogonus is of course
referred to.

26. in aliis rebus : viz. in the proscriptions and confiscations.

27. munitet ε subjunctive in dependent question ; manicare is the
iterative of munio. quod iter adfectet: quod is the reading of the
MSS ; some editors change quod to quo, but viam adfectare 1s a
regular phrase, and quod*³ iter corresponds to quam viam, which
immediately precedes. The expressions are doubtless borrowed
from one of the comic poets.

30. aliquid: accusative of the extent of the action of posse.

32. hoc: ablative of cause, = eo, “for this reason‚'' anticipating
quod, “ because.'' verear : subjunctive denoting the cause assigned

a conjecture for the reading of the MSS. expectata, “ long-expected,'’

the correct reading is excitata. rem publicam : “ the government.''

2. servuli: the diminutive is used contemptuously.

4. hoc : i.e. the victory of the nobility.
