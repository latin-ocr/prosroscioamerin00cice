adeptus est : in a clause dependent on an accusative and infinitive
phrase the subjunctive is regularly used; here the indicative is

presserred, as the clause expresses an independent declaration of
ac .

24. sibi : in a dependent command se refers regularly to the sub-
ject of the principal sentence.

25. quise . . . pungit: in a dependent clause with the verb in
the indicative se usually refers to the subject of its own clause;
here the reference is to the subject of the principal verb (postulat),
and therefore eum would be more regular ; but by the use of se the
relative clause is made to appear as an integral part of the main
clause ( = se stimulantem ac pungentem). Examples of this use of
se for eum are rare in Cicero; they occur mainly in his earlier
works, and are found only when no ambiguity can arise. The irre-
gularity is really in the mood of stimulat, which, as se shows, should
represent the thouyht of Chrysogonus and so be in the subjunctive.
The expression is a compendium of the two—eum stimulat and se
stimulet. ut evellatis . . . ut . . . profiteamini: the first ut intro-
duces a final clause (dependent command) ; the second ut introduces

{conseciffiiye clause, denoting the result of the action expressed
y u eve α ιε.

29. quo modo: this use of quo modo for ut (“as”) in a paren-

thetical clause is rare in Cicero, and found only in his earlier
orations and. in his letters.

h'ch' 111.-2. nostris: the advocate here makes his client’s cause
is own.

5. quod in omnes intenditur: the blow is one which is aimed at
the whole State, if confidence in the courts of justice is destroyed.

6. causa criminis . . . facti suspicio: “ grounds for an accusation

. . reasons for suspecting guilt.’' The genitives are objective.
