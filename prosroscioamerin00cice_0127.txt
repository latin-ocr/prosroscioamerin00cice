ch.XL1V.-1. in quem: “about whom.” in eum: “about hin1.''
Cicero, though throughout this part of his speech there is an under-
current of feeling against the arbitrary measures of Sulla, takes
care to avoid a direct attaek upon the all-powerful dictator.

4. ut: “namely, that.” The clauses introduced by ut are all
substantive clauses explanatory of haec omnia. ementiretur ε used
absolutely, “he told lies. ’²

7. passus non sit: ementiretur, single? et dzce7et are in the ini-

perfect because they expiess the reiterated asseitions of Chry so-
gonus; the perfect 18 here used because it denotes the singley act
which was the culmination and result of the repeated declaratione.

fthe common ante diem quintum, etc„ in dates.

“ 13. pzrofecto ‘in any case. ’' haec bona: i e. the money accruing
from the sale of the property. nulla: adverbiaL “not at all,'’
equivalent to an emphatic non. redierunt: literally‘ ‘have come
in' ’as revenue or income3 i. e “have been registeied” in the State
accounts.

15. corruptae . . . sunt: through the entry being made under a
false date (i. e. one before June lst).

charge of parricidium, the life) of Sex. Roscius was still 111 dangei.

19. reduviam curem: “attend to a hang· nail” on the finger3

28. qua. condicione: = qua fortuna3 he will be content with a
bare acquittal on the charge of parricide.

the substantives of which they are the attributes, often specify
certain parts of those substantives.
