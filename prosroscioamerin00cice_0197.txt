PRO snx. Roscio, ἓξ 51—55. 19

bring himself to overcome the promptings of Nature her·
aelf, to cast out from his heart that affection so deeply
rooted in it, in a word, to forget that he was a father3 a
disaster that I believe could not have happened but for
great offences on the part of my client.

54. But I allow you to pass over those things about
which if you are silent you admit that they do not exist at
all. Your statement that he intended to disinherit his son
you certainly ought to prove. Well then, what reason do
you bring forward to warrant our believing that it was
done}> As a matter of fact you cannot state any. Well,
at any rate draw on your imagination for something to
suit the occasion, so that you may not be clearly seen to

property. What is the conclusion then? You should
have tempered your desire of gain by reflecting that the
opinion of the jury about you and the Remmian law must
have some authority. It is advantageous that there should
be many accusers in the state, provided they are withheld
from recklessness by fear; but nevertheless this is only
advantageous provided that we are not mocked by the
accusers. A certain man is innocent: nevertheless al-
though he is far from blameworthy, yet he is not free from
suspicion. Though it is an irksome task, yet 1 could bring
myself to pardon in one way the man who accuses this
