then fixed t e tenth ay rom the nominis receptio as the
day for the trial. During this interval the accused was
generally allowed to remain at large, and, in case his guilt
was manifest, was even encouraged to seek voluntary exile.
If he adopted the latter course, the case was of course at an
end.

On the day of the trial the jurymen were empanelled in
the way already described, and were put upon their oath.
The prosecutor was generally supported by assistants (sub-
scriptores), and the accused was always represented by at
least · onus), and also by advocati or
advisers. The proceedjngs egan with the speech of the
prosecutor, and this was followed by that of the counse]
for the defence. The evidence of witnesses on either side

times the trial was not fim'shed on the first day, and it was
then adjourned to the next day but one (com erendinatio).
After the altercatio the jurymen voted‚ usually by
ballot, the three possible verdicts being Q: absolvo,
Ω = condemno, or NL z newliquet (“ not proven’'). The
verdict was decideos by the majority of votes, and the
accused was not condemned unless there was an absolute
majority (exclusive of the NL votes) against him. Thus if
there were fifty jurymen, at least twenty-six O votes would
have to be given to secure condemnation3 if there were
only twenty-five O votes, the accused would be acquitted,
even if the other twenty-five votes were all NL. A verdiet
of NL also required an absolute majority of votes, so that
the accused was always acquitted unless more than half of
the jurymen voted either O or NL. A verdict of non liquet
resulted in a second hearing (ampliatio) of the case.
