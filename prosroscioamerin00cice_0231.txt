and frankly, let them refrain from identifying their cause
with that of Chrysogonus, let them give over thinking that
if he is attacked they are disparaged, let them take care
that it does 1101866111 a disgraceful and pitiable thing that
men who could not brook 1116 magnificence of the eques-

trian order can endure the tyranny eof a 16806113] slave3 and
this tyranny, you know, gentlemen, formerly showed 118 elf
in other directions, but now you see the road 11 18 0111011110,

1116 way 11 18 pursuing. It 18 1116 way to your good faith,
the sanctity of your 06111, your 161361 (1601810118, —almost the
only⁷ thing· 111 1116 state that 18 1111601 and inviolate.

1'41. Does Chrysogonus think he has some influence here
too. Ῥ Does he want- to be powei ful here too. ‘9 O shame-
ful and cruel indignity! Yet, by heaven, I am not indig-
nant because I am afraid he has some power, but the point
Ι (10 complain of 18 just this, that he has dared 80 greatly,
11161 he has hoped to have some influence with gentlemen

commouweal‘sh with battle and sword merely that the
f1 6((1111611 and favoui ite slaves of the aristooi 618 might have
the power to plunder our possessions and proper ty‘?

142. If this was their aim Ι confess that I was wrong in
wishing rather for their victory, Ι confess that I lost my
8611868 111 uniting mvself with 1116111 111 sentiment; though
I did not fight,gentle1nen‚1 shared their sentimeiits: 0111
if the victor y of the nobles oug crht to be a distinction and
a gain to the commonwealth and the Roman people, my
speech indeed should be very pleas‘ ’1ος to all the best and
noblest of them. But if there 1s any one who thinks that
both himself and the cause is injured, when Ι vilipend
Chrysogonus, he does not understand the cause, but he
does rightly know himself: for the cause will become
grander if a stand be made against all of the baser 80·;11
68 soon as yonder vile toady of Chrysogonus, who believes
he has a common interest with his master, feels 1111118 elf
injured, he dissociates himself from a cause of such

randeur.
g 143. But 611 11118 part of my speech, as Ι have already
said before, emanates from me alone, and the 1111616818 of
