PRO sssx. Roscm, ἐξ 46—50. 17

you know that from lack of real grounds for accusation
you have turned Sextus Roscius’ chief claim to praise into
a fault and a disgrace. But it is not only at the wish of
their fathers that sons do this3 I have known—and unless
my imagination is misleading me, so have each of you
known—a great many men in whom there has been spon-
taneously kindled a keen interest for agriculture, and who
consider this country life, which you think ought to be a
ground for reproach and accusation, to be most honourable
and. leasant.

491.) What think you was the interest in and knowledge
of the details of a country gentleman's life displayed by
my client Sextus Roscius himself P As I am told by his
relations, who are very honourable gentlemen‚ you are not
more skilful in your profession as accuser than he in his.
However, I suppose, since this is Chrysogonus' pleasure,
and he has left my client not a single estate, my client will
have the privilege of foi-getting his craft and laying aside
his zeal. L,nd although this is a shameful indignity, yet
he will bear it patiently, gentlemen‚ if he can by your help
preserve his life and reputation. This however is indeed
beyond endurance‚ that he has not only fallen into this
disastrous situation owing to the excellence and number of
his estates, but the fact that he took an interest in culti-
vating them is to be turned into the bitterest prejudice
against him, for fear that it were not shame enough for
him to have cultivated them for others instead of himself,
without his having the fact that he cultivated them at all
made a ground for accusation.

50. Of a truth. Erucius, you would have been a ridiculous
accuser had you been born in the days of old, when men
were sunnnoned from the plough to be made consuls. For
since you think it is a disgraceful occupation to superintend
the cultivation of the soil, you would of course set down
the famous Atilius, whom the envoys found sowing the
seed with his own hand, as a base and dishonourable man.
I3ut be assured our ancestors set a far diflerent vaiue on
him and other men like him. And thus it was that they
raised this commonwealth from insignificance and poverty‚
and bequeathed it to us as one of the highest importance
