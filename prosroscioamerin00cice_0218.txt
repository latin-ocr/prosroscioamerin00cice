38 CICERO

near Volaterrae within four days from the time of the
murder. Is there even now any question as to the man who
sent that messenger? Is it not perfectly clear that he is
the same man who sent to Ameria? Chrysogonus, though
knowing nothing about the man or the facts of the case, took
measures to have his goods put up for sale without delay.
But how did it occur to him to covet the estates of a man
who was a stranger to him, whom he had never set eyes on
at all? You generally say at once, gentlemen, when you
hear any question of this sort: Some one of the same town
or neighbourhood must have told him. They are the per-
sons who generally give evidence ; it is through them that
people are generally betrayed. In the case before us, there
is no ground for regarding this fact as a mere matter of

that they themselves do not deny that Chrysogonus took
steps to secure this property at their instigation. If you
fix your eyes upon the man who received his share as
informer, will you find it possible to doubt, gentlemen, who
gave the information? Who therefore, in the case of this
property, are the men to whom Chrysogonus gave a share?
The two Roscii. Was there any one else whatever? No
one, gentlemen. Can there be a doubt, then, that this
plunder was offered to Chrysogonus by the men who
received from him a share of the plunder?

108. Come now, let us consider the action of the Roscii
according to Chrysogonus’ own verdjct: if they had done
nothing worth considering in that battle, why were they
presented with such great rewards by Chrysogonus? If
they did nothing else except carry information about the
