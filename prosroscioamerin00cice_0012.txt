4 INTRODUC'HON.

the second. From the beginning of 43 13.c. until the end
of April, Cicero was in the height of his glory, but before
the end of that year, in the proscription that followed
upon the formation of the Second Triumvirate, Cicero's
name was, on the suggestion of Antonius, put in the list of
those doomed to summary destruction. Soldiers were im-
mediately sent in pursust, and although his attendants
wished to offer resistance‚ Cicero forbade them, and sur-
rendered to his pursuers, by whom he was killed.

In the foregoing sketch no mention has been made of
Cicero's philosophical works, which were both numerous and
important. ,Hjs activity in this direction begins from his
exile in 57 uc. 3 in 55 B.c. he produced the De Oratore, in
54-51 B.c. the De Re Publica, and in 52 B.0. the De Leqibus.
This period of activity was followed by five years (51 to 4ss
uc.) of comparative rest, but in 46 B.c. he wrote the
Hortensius or De Philosophia, a treatise now lost, in addition
to the Partitiones oratoriae, the Brutus or De claris
Oratoribus, and the Orator. During the years 45 and
44 nc. he wrote the De Consolatione, on the occasion of the
death of his daughter Tullia3 the Academica, an account of
the new Academic Philosophy, which maintained that there
was no such thing as certainty—we must be content with
probability3 the Disputationes Tusculanae, treating of
happiness and morality ; the De Natura Deorum, the
De llivinatione (on the subject whether gods communicate
with men by means of augury, eto), the Cato Maior or De
-S'enectute, the De Amicitia, the De Fato (an account of Fate
and Freewill), the Paradoaea (an account of certain para-
‹ioxical opinions of the Stoics), the De Officiis, a treatise on
duty, and the De Finibus, on the Highest Good.

So far we have dealt with Oicero's speeches and philo-
sophical works. In addition to these must be mentioned
(l) his Lelters, of which he wrote a vast number, and of
which more than 800 are preserved 3 (2) his Poetical Worlcs,
which were very poor in quality though not small in
quantity—his chief poem was written on the subject of his
consulship3 and (3) his Historical and Miscellaneoue Worke,
e.9. a prose account of his consulship, an account of his
policy immediately previous to his consulship. eto.
