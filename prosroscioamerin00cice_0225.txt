of my opponents than my case required and sheer necessity
compelled me to say. It is true that many allegations can
be made against them, and each one of these can be ex-
plained by many arguments3 but Ι cannot do at length or
with accuracy of detail what Ι do against my will and of
sheer necessity3 what it was absolutely impossible to pass
over, Ι have touched upon lightly, gentlemen3 the infer-
ences that are grounded in mere suspicions which Ι should
have to discuss at greater length, if once Ι begin, these Ι
leave to your ingenious surmises.

124. Ι now come to that golden name, Chrysogonus,
under which the whole confederacy hides itself: and Ι
cannot discover, gentlemen, how Ι am to speak about it or
how Ι am to hold my tongue. For if I hold my tongue,
Ι omit perhaps the chief part of my defence3 but if Ι
speak Ι am afraid that not only he (and for that I
do not care at all), but a good number of others also
may think themselves injured. And yet my case is

property should be put up for sale; for if the time comes
when these complaints will be listened to and freely dis-
cussed‚ Sextus Roscius was not so important a man in the
state that we should complain about him more than
others. But this is the question Ι put: how could they by
that very law of theirs about proscription, whether it 18
the Valerian or the Corneliam—I am not acquainted with
them and Ι do not know,—by that very law, I repeat, how
could Sextus Roscius’ property be put up for sale?

126. They say that the terms are as follows :—“ That
the goods of those who have been proscribed be sold '’:
but Sextus Roscius does not fall under this category: ‘⁴ or
of those who have been killed while within the enemy's
lines: ’² while there were any lines, he was within the lines
