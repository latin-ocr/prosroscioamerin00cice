Sulla had increased the number of the praetors from six to
eight3 of these, two were to have charge of the civil courts,
while the other six were to preside over the quaestiones
perpetuae. Thus the praetors were the ordinary or normal
presidents of the standing crimina] courts, and the latter
were distributed among the various praetors by lot. But
from the time of Sulla there were more quaestiones than
there were praetors available for criminal jurisdiction;
moreover, in some cases the quaestio had to be divided into
several branches‚ each branch being under a separate presi-
dent& Hence additional presidents had to be appointed.
These were called quaesitores (a name also given to the
praetors as criminal judges).

It seems to have been only in the case of the court
established by the lem cle sicariis et veneficis that these
presidents were regularly appointed functionaries, bearing
the official title of iudex quaestionis. At any rate it is only in
murder trials that we find mention of a iudex quaestionis,
who is formally appointed (probably by the people)‚ and
who is obliged to swear that he will administer justice
according to the law by which he is appointed. In the case
of the other comts, the additional presidents were probably
