that you not only see your charge rebound therefrom, but
you perceive that every suspicion recoils upon yourselves.

80. What follows then? Pray where does the accuser
take refuge in his lack of arguments? ‘⁴ The times were
so disastrous,’' says he, “that men were murdered with
impunity quite commonly, and therefore you could have
done this deed without any trouble, owing to the vast
number of murderers.'' You sometimes appear to me,
Erucius, to be killing two birds with one stone, to be
striking at us through the verdict, while accusing the very
persons from whom you received the bribe. What do you

perchance you are waiting for me to refute the accusations
about embezzlement of state property and imaginary
offences of that sort, of which we heard nothing before and
which are quite new to us. These he seemed to me to be
declaiming from another speech, which he was preparing
against another prisoner; so far were they from having
anything to do with the charge of parricide or with the
man who is on his trial: and since he supports his charges
by assertion, it is enough to deny them by assertion. If
