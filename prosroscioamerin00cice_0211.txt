PRO sax. ROSCIO, ἐς 89-93. 33

everything into disorder: and Ι am astonished they did
not burn up even the benches‚ so as to leave no traca of
the law-courts: for they removed both the accusers and
the jurymen. It is an advantage that they lived in such
a way that they could not kill every witness if they wanted
to ; for so long as the human race exists, there will not be
wanting some one to accuse them: so long as the constitu-
tion lasts, trials wffl be held. But, as Ι began to say, if
Erucius also had in his case the arguments Ι have men-
tioned at length, he would be able to go on stating them
as long as he liked, and I, gentlemen‚ am able to do so,
but my intention is, as I said before, to pass over them
lightly and merely to glance at each detail singly, that the
world may know Ι am making my accusation not from
inelination but at the demands of duty.

92. Well then, Ι see that there are many motives which
might have urged him 011. Let us now see whether he had
any opportunity of committing the crime. Where was
Sextus Roscius murdered? At Rome. Why Ρ Where
were you at that time, Roscius? At Rome. But how
does that bear upon the question? Many others were
there too. As if the question now at issue were who out
of this great population committed the murder, and we
were not inquiring precisely this, whether it is more
probable that the man who was murdered at Rome was
murdered by the man who at that time was continually at
Rome, or by the man who for many years has altogether
abstained from coming to Rome.

93. Come, now let us think over his other opportunities
besides. At that time there was a vast number of assassins
ahmad, as Erucius has told you, and men were murdered
with impunity. Again‚ of whom did that vast number
consist? Ι suppose either of those who did business in
property or of those who were hired by them to murder
some one. If you think they were men who were seeking
after other people's property, you are in that category‚ for ’
you are enriched by our money3 but if you think they are
men whom those who use the gentler name call “ stab-
bers‚'’ ask in whose service and under whose patronage
they are, and you will, Ι assure you, find a certain member
