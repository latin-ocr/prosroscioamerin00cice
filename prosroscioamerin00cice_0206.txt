was when you were his supporters, when you were conduct-
ing his case, that Sextus Roscius several times demanded
from his opponents two of his father's slaves for torture :
do you remember that Titus Roscius refused? Why?
Where are those slaves? They are in the retinue of
Chrysogonus, gentlemen: with him they are honoured and
valued. Even now 1 demand that they be examined, my
client entreats and beseeches it.

78. What are you doing. 9 Why do you refuse. 9 Now
be uncertain, gentlemen, if you can, by whom Sextus

that Sextus Roscius not only did none of those acts, but
that he could not have done so, because he had not been
in Rome for several yearS‚ and had never left his estates
without due cause. There apparently remained to you
the mention of slaves, to which you could fly as to a haven
when driven back from your other attempts at raising sus-
picion, but where you strike upon a rock so dangerous
