(defendants). secuti: sc. esse ; 111 the sense 01 following a clue, “ to
have allowed themselves to be guided by.'’

ditional clause is quasi· negativ‚e “11 you have found anything αι
all” (not“ any thing you like’ ’‚) with the implication that they will
not find anything. causae: partitive genitive, depending on quw-
quam.
10. inveneritis: its action is looked 011 as antecedent to that

18. qui ex civitate in senatum propter dig-nitatem: those who
had held curule office (i.e. who had been consuls, praetors, censorS‚ or
curule aediles) became senators after their year 01 office. By Sulla’s
constitution ex-quaestors also became senators. All these magis-
trates were elected by the people, so that the people indirectly
elected the senators. Sulla had also filled up the ranks 01 1110 Senate
by allowing the T ribal Assembly 01 1110 People (comitia tributa) to
elect 300 equites as senators.

19. ex senatu in hoc consilium delecti estis propter severitatem :
the iudices for particular cases were selected by lot from the division
(decuria) assigned by the praetor. It is thus difficult to explain
delecti . . . propter severitatem. Severitas in any case means “upright
character'' rather than “ severity.'' It is probable that the praetor
drew up the annual register 01 jury nien (album iudicum) by making
a selection from the whole body 01 the senators, and that these
selected jurymen were du 1ded either by lot or by selection, into
decuriae3 from one 01 1110 latter (assigned by the praetor according
to its precedence on the list) the iudices for each particular case
were chosen by lot. See also Introd.‚ ἓ 7.
