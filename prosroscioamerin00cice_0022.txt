14 INTRODUCTION.

criminal procedure were 111 the hands of the pontiffs, and
rested on a purely religious basis. When the Republic
had become firmly established the power of the pontiffs
passed away, and while civil cases were tried by a magis-
trate together with a iudex, or by an arbitrator, according
to the forms of the leqis actiones, political and ordinary
criminal cases were brought before the people in their
courts (iudicia populi).

The magistrates, either directly or as a result ofa aepp eal
from their& sentences (3229th appeared as accusers in
these comts, and after due investigation proposed a penalty
in the form of a bill r³0sat before the people in the
comitia (the comitia tri uta When the maximum penalty
Was a fine, the comitia centuriata when the charge was a
capital one), and this penalty was either accepted or
rejected by the people, The accusing magistrates wele

quaestors)‚ the aediles, or the tribunes; the latter, when
the penalty was a fine, brought the case before the
concilium plebis.

„Pei-manent Commissions. In 149 Β.ο. the first permanent
commission (iudicium publicum or quaestio perpetua) was
est· iblished, by the Lex Calpurnia, for the trial of cases of
extol tion (olerepetunclis). After this date permanent com-
missions gradually came to take the place of the iudicia
2² otpuli, though there were survivals of the latter even in
Cicer'os day. A special law, which named the offences
liable to punishment and determined the penalty in each
case, regulated the procedure of each quaestio. Most of the
laws establishing standing courts before the time of Sulla
were Zeqes de pecuniis repetundis, or laws constituting courts
