Ch. XXV. —1. itaque: this belongs' m sense to the words sinyulare
supplicium· invenerunt. Logically, othe whole sentence would run.
itaque maiores nostri in impios sinyulare supplicium invenerunt,
quorum consilium et sapientia cum multis ex rebus, tum ex hac re
intelliyi potest· , but the original construction of the sentence is
altered, owing to the reference to other nations, which is intended
to introduce the comparison with the Athenians. multis ex rebus :
“from many other things.”

(5. prudentissima: predioative,comp1eting the meaning of

uisse
s 7. dum ea rerum potita est: ‘so long as it enjoyed the supre-
macyss 'i. e over Greece. The Athenian supreniacy or‘ ‘''Hegemony

ἓ lasted from 478 to 404 Β. c. potita est: potior is iare in the sense of

{ff

‘to bein possession of anything. '² Dum, meaning‘ ‘all the time

, that,'' as here, takes a past tense in hlstm 10 sequence; in the mean-

ing 'of‘ ‘during the time that” it takes the present indicative,
whatever the sequence.

9. quibus hodie quoque utuntur: Greece had been placed, since
its subjugation in 146 13.c.‚ under the general supervision of the
governor of the province of Macedonia; but Athens, Sp arta, and
some other states were liberae civitates and preserv ed their autonomy,
including the right of jurisdiction.

10. scripserit. subjunctive in dependence on an accusative and
infinitive phrase. Halm proposes scripsit for the MSS. reading
scripserit. Utuntur is indicative, though dependent on the sub-
junctive scripserit, since it occurs in a relative clause introduced by
Cicero for the benefit of his hearers (cp. 24, 12).

ll. necasset. subjunctive in a clause dependent on the sub-
junctive clause cur. ‚constituisset‚ which 1s a dependent question;
necasset represents the future perfect indicativ 6 (necaverit) of direct
s eech.

Ι)13. sanxerit. . videretur: the time of the direct statement is
retained (Solon de eo nihil sanxit, ne videi etur)

17. supplicium in parricidas singulare: the Lex Cornelia de
‚³,8icariis et veneficis which established the quaestio inter sicarios,
·before which Roscius was tried, had special clauses relating to
parricidium3 it provided that fo’r this offence the old poena cullei
(line 20) should be enforced (Introd. ἓ 8)· , it als o probably ordained
that the trial of so unnatural a crime should take place extra

, ordinem, i.e. apart from the regular list of criminal cases.

19. potuisset: “had not been able ”3 the pluperfect is used
because the action represented in potuisset (i. e. the murder itself)
comes in time before the consideration of the penalty (submoverentur).

The subjunctive is due to the clause being dependent on a sub-
junctive dependent clause.
