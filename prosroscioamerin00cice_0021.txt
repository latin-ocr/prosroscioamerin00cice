generous and vigorous youth. “Amid what shouts of
applause,’' he says in his Orator (a work composed thirty-
four years 61161 the Pro 1103610),ι ‘did I, while quite a
youth, deliver those words on the punishment 01 parricides;
long afterwards I still felt that the fire of those words was
by no means cool.’' He then quotes the highly wrought
passage in Oh. XXVI.‚ lines 11-17, with this criticism:
“ All those expressions bear the stamp of youth‚—youth
that is commended 101· hopeful promise rather than for
ripe performance.” He adds: “even that youthful
exuberance is tempered with much that is subdued, and
with some passages that are even somewhat genial.’'

This criticism 01 1113 own early (16166133 13 6 just 0116.
The style 01 1116 speech is in many places florid and re-
dundant, and the periods are not marked by that rounded
fulness, or the transitions by that 6636 and naturalness
which are characteristic 01 1113 riper work. There is also

when we consider the speech as a whole. Not only does
it abound with really splendid passages, but the general
impression made upon 1116 reader is one 01 dignified in-
dependence and high 1110161 10116. The youthful mator
was thoroughly convinced that 1113 661136 was a righteous
one, and this conviction lends 6 liveh'ness and elevation to
the entire speech. The manly courage with which he
confionted the powers 01 evil arrayedD against him com-
mands our admiration3 it is only equalled by the
moderation 01 the speaker, and the marvellous skill
with which he avoided giving offence to the all-powerful
Dictator.
