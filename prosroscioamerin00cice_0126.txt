118 menno: PRO Roscm. [cn. xn111.

13. †si enim haec audientur ac libere dicentur: this is the reading
of the MSS„ in place of which several needless conjectures have
been proposed. Translate: “for if the time comes when people
will listen to these complaints and they can be freely discussed.''
Cicero means that when that time comes‚—and the “reign of
terror'' is too fresh in men’s memories for it to come yet awhile,—

the cases of the more important victims of the proscriptions will be ,

taken before that of Sex. Roscius3 all that is now asked is, how
could the property of Sex. Roscius be sold contrary to the express
wording of the law?
⁴ 16. qui: adverb, “ how.’' ista ipsa lege, quae de proscriptione est,
sive Valeria sive Cornelia: the lex Cornelia de proscriptione seems to
ζ have &effa kind of’p'ffifilamation issued by Sulla at the time of the
5publieation of the proscription list, which laid down rules about

ἶ’[,118 property of the proscribed‚ etc. It was thus a lex data or
magisterial enae‘cment, not a lex roqata, or utterance of the people
ῗ in their comitia ; and since Sulla was not yet dictator, and the con-
stitution was not yet suspended, such an act would have no binding

force. The lex Valeria (see Introd. ‚ 52), which conferred dictatorial

{Jand ratified all the acts which Sulla had done, his lex Cornelia de
{proscriptione would among his other acts be made legally valid.
&Cicero is therefore here justified in his expression of ignorance as to
‘which of the two leges should be cited as regulating the proscrip-
¹tions‚—-for the Lex Cornelia laid down the actual regulations, while
‘the Lex Valeria gave validity to the Lex Oomzelia. Cicero also
seems to imply that, since both enactments were really the work of
*the all-powerful Sulla, they could not be distinguished by means of
'different names,—they were both in a sense Leyes Corneliae.

19. scriptum enim ita dicunt esse : Cicero here (and also in
44, 10), somewhat ironically professes not to know the exact ternis
of the Lex Cornelia, since it had not been brought before the people ;
and though the Lex Valeria, which gave it formal validity, was
ratified by the people, yet this ratification was but the ‘⁶ mockery
of a free choice,” for the people dared not refuse to ratify an ap-
pointment which Sulla had practically ordered the Senate to make.

21. quo in numero: i.e. in quorum numero.

23. {uerunt : perfect, as dum: “ so long as‚’' not ‘⁶ during the
time t at.'

25. si lege: sc. occisus est.

27. veteres leges : according to the old leges sacratae a man who
was declared accursed (sacer) was cut off from the fire and water of
his tribe (aquae et iyni interdictus) and any one could slay such an
outlaw with impunity. Sulla applied this mode of punishment to
his political opponents‚ by meting out rewards to those who slew,
and punishments to those who harbonred, proscribed persons. The

’ἶ reference in novae Zeqes is especially to the Lex Cornelia de proscrip-

tione. occisum esse: sc. eum as subject.
