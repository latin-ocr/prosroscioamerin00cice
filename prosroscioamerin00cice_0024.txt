lee Jurors iu the Stomdinq Gommissions. The jurors
(iudices) of the quaestiones perpetuae were originally
senators3 from 1⁶23 B.C. (the date of the Lem Sempronia
iudiciaria of C. Gracchus) they were chosen from the
equestrian order. 1n 81 B.o. the Lex Cornelia of Sulla
restored the criminal courts to the Senate. Sulla also in-
creased the number of senators to about six hundred. For
various reasons, however, about one-third of the senators
would be unable to undertake judicia] functions3 hence at
the beginning of each year a list (album iudicum) of the
senators who could serve in the courts was drawn up by
the urban praetor, who was bound by cath to select only
the worthiest of the senators. The iudices thus selected
were then divided into sections called deeuriae3 the
number of these is unknown, but under Sulla there were
but few.

Particular decuriae were not assigned to particular courts‚
but whenever a case came on for trial a decuria, determined
according to its place on the list, was assigned to this
case. The praetor chose by lot from this decuria as many
iudices as would suffice for the trial after some had been
rejected by each of the contending parties, who always
exercised the right of challenging (reiectio). When the
decuria thus assigned had already been depleted, and
therefore could not supply enough jurors, it was filled up
(by the process called subsortitio) from the decuria next on
the list.

'Phe right of accusation in a quaestio perpetua belonged to
any citizen‚—there were no public prosecutors. The accuser
first asked the president of the court (i.e. the praetor,
quaesitor, or iudea) quaestionis) for permission 130 bring the
charge. If this were granted, he definitely denounced the
accused (rigmaffldgmtio). The president, if he decided to
go on with the case, then drew up a statement of the
charge (inscriptio) and formally admitted 13116 accusation
