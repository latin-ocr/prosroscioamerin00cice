crime and reckless daring.

18. For when my client Sextus Roscius was in Ameria,
while Titus Roscius, the prosecutor, was at Rome3 when
my client the son and'heir was busy 011 1113 estates, and
when in accordance with his father's wishes he had devoted
himself to the management of the property and the life of
a country gentlemen, whjle the prosecutor was constantly
at Rome, near the Pallacinian baths, as he was returning
from a dinner-party, Sextus Roscius was murdered. I
