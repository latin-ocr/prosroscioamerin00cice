cn. xxm] sorus, 101

i 19. una mercede duas res adsequi: lit. “to obtain two articles
> for one payment’' ; the corresponding English proverb is “ to kill

'if—”3 - two birds with one stone.’' †nos iudicio pertundere: “to strike

at us through the verdict.’' The MSS. read perfundere, which
seems to have no point here. Pessundare, pervertere, confundere,
percutere have been suggested. Pertunda-e (a conjecture of G.
Ammon) is a synonym of percutere (which expresses the meaning
, well) and has the advantage of being closer to the reading of the
, MSS. than any other emendation. The infinitives pertundere and
¹ accusare, which should depend on adsequi velle, are loosely connected
-. with videris velle.

22. sectoribus: the property of a proscribed person was sold by
public auction (sub hasta, the spear being the symbol of booty
taken in war). Such a sale was called sectio and the purchaser was
called sector. The word seems to be derived from secare, ‘⁶ to cut‚⁷’

ἢ ἢ but the name was certainly not given because the purchasers of a

property (which was always sold to a single person) parcelled it out
into small lots with the purpose of selling it again. It is probable that
sectio was originally used to designate that part of the booty which
, was “ cut off ’' or set apart for the State, as distinguished from the
” shares of the general and the soldiers. The word was then trans-
ferred from the sale oi booty taken in war to the sale of confiscated
property. Thus though sectio still has some of its original meaning,
·, sector in this derived sense has none. In the same way the holder of
ἶ an “ open scholarship '³ at the universities is called an ‘⁶ open scholar.'’
. 23. eosdem . . . collorum et bonorum ε the play on the word sector
' may be represented in English by ‘⁶ those same brokers were
generally the men who broke neoks.’'

· 24. denique : expresses the speaker’s indignation, “shall it be

that . . . ‘2³’

25. concursabant: = circumamsabant.

26. adsidui : = adsidue, “continually.’'

29. crimini: predicative dative, accompanied by huic as dative
of indirect object; “is to be a ground of accusation against my
client.''

34. disseram: present subjunctive rather than future indicative
here.

35. dissoluta est ε the regular word for the unravelling of decep—
tive and sophistical questions ; it is here used of the refutation of
charges for the adequate reply to which dialectical acumen is needed.
See also diluam in line 36.

36. de peculatu: “about the embezzlement of State property.'’
Erucius must have insinuated that Roscius had secretly kept back
some of his father's confiscated property.

38. declamare . . . commentari z technical expressions 3 commentari
refers to the mental preparation or “ getting up ” of a speech ;
declamare refers to the private “ practising ” of it aloud, before the
public delivery ; the word conveys no notion of “ bawling,’' as some
suppose.
