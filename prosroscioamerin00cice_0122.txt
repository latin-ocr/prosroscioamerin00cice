chargye of an ‘zuzimportant commission is punished with insamy, how

mission.''

10. is inter honestos homines atque adeo inter vivos numera—

nien, and in fact does not deserve a place among citizens at all.

12. †etiam negligentia in crimen mandati iudiciumque infamia
rei vocatur: the Ms. reading is irrsamia revocatur. Some editors
strike out mandati, and others read infamiae vocatur for infamia
revocatur. The emendation adopted in the text is that of Richter,
and the words may be thus rendered—“even neglect is made a
ground for a charge of breach of trust and for a trial, owing to the
dishonour attaching to such conduct-'³

15. publice: = ea· decurionum decreto. commissa sit: the subjunc-
tive is chosen rather than the indicative, as the statement has a

su ijunctives.

that Sextus would recognise any agreement made by Capito.

22. ille: Capito. recepisset: “had definitely promised.”

23. tantulum : “the mcrest tittle.”

24. per arbitrum: mandate (mandatum) was a bonae fidei con-
tract, that is to say, it was based upon the mutual trust of the
contracting parties, and its settlement was a matter of equity rather
than of strict law. The actiones or iudicia arising from this class
of contracts were decided by an arbiter (arbitrator), not by a iudex
(judge). While the iudex could only condemn or aequit in accord-
anoe with the strict legal instructions of the praetor, the arbiter did
not give his decision till he had weighed the special circumstances
of the case and the rival claims of the parties. rem restitueret:
i.e. should pay damages in default of actual restitution. honestatem
omnem amitteret: = ivfamisfieret.

28. ex eo ι comprehensively, “ of the objects of that trust.’'
