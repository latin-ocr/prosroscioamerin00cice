ἓ 2. The Political situation at the time of the Speech.
Cicero's speech in defence of Sextus Roscius was the first
oration delivered by him in a state or criminal trial (causa
publica). Roscius was charged with parricide, and was
tried before the murder court in Q 13.c„ during the

reward of 12,000 denarii was offered to anyone who killed
an ‘⁶ outlaw.’' The work of murder was diligently pur-
