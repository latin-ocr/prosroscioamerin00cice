man: for, when he has something to say which involves a
charge and a suspicion, he would not appear to be of set
purpose mocking and slandering him openly.

56. This is the reason that we readily allow the exist-
ence of as many accusers as possible, because an innocent
man can be acquitted after being accused, a guilty man
cannot be condemned without being accused3 and it is,
of course, more expedient that an innocent man should be
acquitted than that a guilty one should not be tried. The
Geese are fed by public contract and the Dogs are kept on
the Capitol, to give warning of the approach of thieves.
You will say that they cannot distinguish thieves3 well,
but they give warm'ng if any one comes into the Capitol
by night, because such an occurrence excites suspicion, and,
although they are brute beasts, they err rather on the side
of caution. But if the dogs were to bark by day as well,
when any persons come to worship the gods, I believe their
legs would be broken, because they show their keenness
even at a time when there is no ground for suspicion.

57. The case is very much the same with accusers: some
of you are geese, who only make a noise but can do no
harm, some are dogs who can both bark 6116 bite. We see
your food 1s being given to you; and you ought above all
‘things 10 attack those who deserve it; thjso is what the
people like best: after that if you wish', just at the very
moment when some one has committed a crime, you must
bark from suspicion. That also may be granted. But if
you are going so far as to charge a man with having mur-
dered 1118 father without being able to state why or how he
did it, and if you mean to bark with hardly any ground for
suspicion, 110 0116 will break your legs3 but if I know these
gentlemen well, that letter, to which you have been so
bitter a foe as actually to hate all the Calends‚ will be so
firmly fixed upon your forehead as to make it impossible
for you hereafter to find fault with any one else save only
your own destiny.

58. What have you given me as subject-matter for my
defenee, my kind accuser? What have you given these
gentlemen 68 grounds for suspicion? “ He was afraid of
being disinherited.'' So you say, but no one states any
