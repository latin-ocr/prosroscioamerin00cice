cn. xxxv] noras, 109

011 a historic main verb. The perfect represents voluit (in cur voluit),
and the actual result rather than the natural consequence is thus
emphasised.

12. nisi hoc = hoc tamen.

15. non: with nunc primum.

16. palmas: the “victories” of a gladiator; used sarcastically
with reference to murders and other crimes.

ἒ 17. lemniscatam: “decked with ribands'’; a palma lemniscala

was apalm-branch (the usual token of victory) adorned with ribands
{Z and presented to a general or gladiator when his victory had been
1 0110 out of the common. Cicero of course here implies that the

³ murder of Roscius was one which brought Capito more profit than

usual. quae Roma ei deferatur z the neighbourhood of Ameria had
hitherto been the scene of Capito’s murders. It is implied that it
was more difficult for a gladiator to win a victory at Rome than in
other parts of Italy.

20. quem contra. morem maiorum minorem annis sexaginta de
ponte in Tiberim deiecerit: the centuries composing the comitia
centuriata voted in the Campus Martius; and the voters passed
by means of pontes or narrow railed galleries to their separate
voting compartments (consaepta), of which there was one for each
century. The centuries in each class consisted of iuniores (from
18 to 45 years of age) and of seniores (from 46 to 60). Since the
assembly was essentially a military one, those over the age of
compulsory service, i.e. over 60, should not logically have had any

γ part in it. But it is certain that the list of seniores contained the

³ ν ⁷ ς names of men over 60, and the younger men would often thrust them

back from the voting-galleries, 011 the ground that those who could

ζ 110 longer fight ought not to be allowed a voice in the decision of
2 military questions To this hustling from the pontes of the old men
by the {oung the expression sexayenarios de ponte deicere was trans-

ἑ ferred

y way of a pun; for the expression itself originated in an

old custom by which every year on the Ides of May the Pontifices

and the Vestal Virgins threw into the Tiber from the Pons Sublicius
twenty-four Arqci, which were figures of men made of rushes.
These figures probably took the place of the sexagenarians who were
actually thrown into the Tiber 111 the early days of human sacrifice.

21. si prodierit : i.e. as witness.

22. proditurum esse : sc. eum as subject. audiet: Cicero threatens
that in his cross-examination of the witnesses on the opposite side
(cestium interroyatio) he will bring to light all the crimes of Capito,
and in this way shake his credibility as a witness.

23. volumen z “ r011.” quod conscripsisse : advocates were accus-
tomed to “ coach ’' their witnesses before the trial by giving them a
list of the questions likely to be put to them by the opposite side ;
11010, however, Cicero implies that Erucius intends knowingly to
produce a lying witness, and that he has instructed him in the false
evidence that he is to give. ’

26. pro testimonio: “as evidence.''
