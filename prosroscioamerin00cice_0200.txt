public; the conspiracy is being very roughly handled; his
powerful influence is being treated lightly3 the jurymen
are paying careful attention3 the people think the case a
scandal.

61. Since these things have escaped your notice, Erucius,
and since you see that all is changed, that Sextus Roscius’
cause is being pleaded‚ if not satisfactorily, yet at least
outspokenly3 that the man you thought was being handed
over to you is being defended3 that those you expected
would betray him are judging the case; give us back now
if ever your old and famous cunning and skill, or confess
that you came here with the expectation that this would

herself eries out against suspicions of the sort γοα enter-
