PRO snx. Roscm, ἓξ 9-14., 5

and sternly impartial; this is the first trial for a long time
that is being held for murder, though foul and shameful
murders have been committed in the meantime. All hope
that with you for praetor this court will effect their deliver-
ance from evident cases of crime and the blood shed that is
daily occurring.

12. The loud appeals that prosecutors have been accus-
tomed to make in other triaIS, we who are pleading in this
case make use of on this occasion: we ask you, Marcus
Fannius, and you, gentlemen of the J ury, to punish crimes
with all possible severity, to withstand men of reckless
daring with all possible fortitude, to reflect upon this fact,
that unless you display your real purpose in this case,
there is now such an outburst of evil passions and crime
and recklessness that murders will be committed not only
in secret but even here in the forum before your tribunal,
Marcus Fannius, before your feet, gentlemen of the J ury,
amidst these very bencheS.

13. For what else are they trying to effect by this trial
except that the doing of such a deed may be lawful? The
accusers are the men who have seized my client’s property:
the defendant is the man whom they have left nothing but
ruin ; the accusers are the men to whom the murder of
the father of Sextus Roscius was an advantage : the
defendant is a man ‘oo whom his father’s death brought
not only grief but destitution3 the accusers are the men
whose chief desire was to cut the throat of this very man :
the defendant is the man who has actually come to this
very court with an escort, that he may not be slain here on
this very spot before your own eyes3 in fine, the accusers
are the men whom the people are demanding for trial:
the defendant is the man who alone has been left over to
survive the horrible massacre perpetrated by those men.

14. And to enable you to understand more readily,
gentlemen of the Jury, that the deeds themselves were
more shocking than my description of them, I will set
before you the history of the case from its commencement,
my object being to enable you to apprehend more readily
the distress of my guiltless client, the reckless daring of
our opponents, and the disastrous state of our country.
