PRO smx. ROSCIO, ἓξ 127-131. 47

suaded that Ι am speaking partly on my own account and
partly for Sextus Roscius. For those proceedings which
seem to me to be shameful and intolerable, and which I
believe are reaching out to all 01 115, 11 110 (10 not take care,
I declare openly on my own behalf and prompted by my
own feelings 01 indignation: the details that have to do
with the (10101100 01 my client’s vital interests, what defence
he wishes to be made for himself, and with what terms he
is satisfied, Ι will shortly tell you, gentlemen, at the end 01
111 5 00011.

311311). Ι put these questions to Chrysogonus 01 my own
free will, quite apart from Sextus Roscius: first, why was
the property 01 a blameless citizen put up 101· sale? next,
why was the property 01 aman, who was neither proscribed
nor killed within the enemy’s lines, put up for sale, when
the 101-1115 01 the law affected only such persons? next, why
was it put up 101 sale some time after that date which was
fixed as the limit in the law? next, why was it sold for so
small a sum? And if he chooses to heap all this on the
shoulders 01 his patron, as rascally and worthless freedmen
are wont to do, it will be 01 110 avail ; 101 there is no one
who does not know that, owing to the vast range 01 1115
affairs, many persons have done many a deed in secret with-
out the knowledge 01 Ι,1101115 Sulla.

131. Do you approve then 01 the fact that in these
matters something is passed over without notice? You do
not approve 01 it, gentlemen, but it is a necessity. For 11
Jupiter the best and greatest, by whose nod and will heaven
and earth and sea are ruled‚ has often, by furious winds or
severe seasons or excessive heat or unendurable cold, done
harm to men, destroyed their cities, and ruined their crops,
none 01 11111011 things we believe to have been done by the
divine will 101 the purpose of doing us any injury, but by
the mere force in the universe and its vast range ; whereas
to counterbalance this we see that the blessings we posseSS,
the light we enjoy, and the air we breathe are given and
granted to us by him, why should we be surprised that
Lucius Sulla, when he alone was directing the common-
wealth and was guiding the world, and was establishing by
laws the imperial sovereignty which he won by arms.
