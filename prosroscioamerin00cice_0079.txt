cn. 11.] noras. 71

12. huiusce: -ce is deicti03 “this man here‚'' i.e. “my olient.⁷’
sexagiens: sc. centenis mitibus sestertium, milibus being the instru-
mental ablativo denoting value. In expressing hundreds of
thousands of sestertii, if the amount was not less than one
million the words centena mitia were omitted, and the number of
hundreds of thousands was denoted by an adverbial numeral. As
1000 sestertii traditionally = 58 10s., 60 >< 100,ΟΟΟ (or 6‚000‚000)
sestertii = 2651‚000. These English equivalents must be regarded as
only very roughly correct, as the value of silver and the purchasing
power of money, on which the calculation depends, are not constant
quantities.

13. de viro clarissimo et· fortissimo, L. Sulla: for Sulla see

3„- Introd., § 2, and Index. After his victory at the Colline Gate
7 (82 Β.0.) Sulla had lists of his enemies posted up in the Forum.
²‘ Those who had been thus “proscribed’' were deolared to be
ξ public enemies, and their property was confiscated and sold by the
{Dictator as representative of the State. quem honoris causa.
ἓ· nomino: “whom I mention with all respect.⁷⁷ This formula was
’,Ξ used in the case of persons of rank orbimpogtancffebwho were still
’ἶ living, and. who might not care for their names to be mentioned in-
- connection with the matter under discussion. Cicero of course did
not wish to offend the all-powerful Dictator.

14. duobus milibus: ablativo of price. nummum: genitive
plural, = sestertiorum. 2,000 sestertii z 2617.

15. vel : serves here to weaken the force of potentissimus, to which
it belongs, the words being used almost in a contemptuous sense,
“the most powerful, or nearly so.'' civitatis: partitive genitive
with potentissimus.

.: 16. L. Cornelius Chrysogonus: see Introd, ξ 3. Chrysogonus,
at the time of his manumission by Sulla, would receive the prae-
3⁷ nomen (Lucius) and the nomen (Cornelius) of his patron. The name
Ξ Chrysogonus, being placed at the end of the period, is emphatic by
position 3 by this means Cicero produced a “ sensation in court,'' as
ἱ no one expected that he would venture to mention the powerful
«ἕ freedman.

17. pecuniam ι = patrimonium (line 2l)—-“ property‚’' as often.

18. nullo iure: ablative of attendant circumstances. invaserit:
subjunctive of reported cause. Cicero ironically represents Chryso-
gonus himself as giving this as the reason for his demand. So also
videatur in the next line.

21. hoc . . . huius: these words refer to the same person
(Roscius); Ῑιοο incolumi is ablative of attendant circumstances;
through being separated from the main clause it gains in signifi-
eance and is contrasted more effectively with damnato et eiecto (a
similar ablati ve).

22. eiecto z sc. e civitate3 Roscius, if he saw that he was likely to
be condemned, could forestall the death penalty by voluntary exile.

23. sperat se posse : spero usually takes the accusative and future
infinitive 3 here posse effundere is practically equivalent to a future.
