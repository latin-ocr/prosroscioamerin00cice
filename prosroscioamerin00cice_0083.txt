under the Cornelian law. There had been no regular trials for
murder during the Civil War and the Sullan proseriptions. It is

. doubtful whether any permanent quaestio iuter sicarios was estab-
. lished until 81 B.c. (cp. 4, 19, n.). Before this date, special com-
, missions were appointed by the people to try cases of murder.

longo intervallo: ablative of attendant circumstances3 lit. “the
interval being long.’' “after a long interval.’' inter sicarios: the

⁴ ’ crime of parricidium was embodied in the Lex Cornelia de sicariis

et veneficis, which established a quaestio for cases of assassination,
poisoning‚ and arson. The functions of the court were divided
between the praetor to whom the particular court had been assigned
by lot and iudices quaestionis, who were, in the case of the murder
court, probably appointed by the people. There was in Latin no
single word for the crime of “ niurder'' or “ assassination.” Since
the expressions sicae deferre and de sica deferre were not practicable,
the phrase for a charge of assassination was ita deferre ut nomen
alicuius inter sicarios referatur, which was abbreviated into iuter

Ξ sicarios deferre ; hence the quaestio concerned was known as quaes-tio

,¹ intleg ,sicarios as well as quaestio de sicariis. committitur: “is being
ie .

6. factae sint: most editions have the indicative (the regular
mood after cum interea), but the subjunctive is preferable here,
since interea does not refer to the time of committitur but to lonqo
intervallo ; cum = “although‚’' “and yet‚'' not “ at the time when.”

7. †vindicationem sui: this is a recent emendation for the
meaningless demissuis or dimissui of the MSS. Other emendations
are diqnissimam (Madvig), sanguini remedium esse (Landgraf). Vin-
dicatz'onem sui here means “ their defence ” or ‘⁶ their deliverance.”

8. vociferatione: “loud appeal.”

10. causam dicimus: “make our defence'’; causam dicere is
applicable both to the advocate and the defendant. Cicero here
ffakes his client's case his own by using an expression common to

oth.

13. sit: subjunctive in indireet question depending on ostendetis.

14. ostendetis z vividly used for ostendatis, the regular subjunctive
in indireet speech depending on cogitetis. eo: the correlative is ut
(line 15), “to this extent, that.” prorumpere : “seeks to burst its
bounds '' ; the future might have been expected.

„³ subsellia: crimina] trials took place in the Forum, under the open
’ἶ sky. Here on a raised platform (tribunal) was the chair of office
. (sella curulis) of the praetor or the iudex quaestionis, and around it
jj , ² the benches (subsellia) of the iudices and clerks of the court (scribae) 3
'j' lower down (antepedes vestros), on the ground in front of the tribunal,
were the benches for the two parties to the suit, their advocates,

’ῑ and their witnesses. There was also an outer ring (corona) of

listeners interested in the case.
20. causam dicit: see note on line 10 above. Cicero here again
makes his client's case his own.
