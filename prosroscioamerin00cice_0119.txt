might also possibly be consecutive, ‘⁴ more concealed than is usual.’²

XXXVII„ ἐξ 105-108. Anemurium—It was the Roscii who sent the
tidinys of the murder lo Chrysoyonus at Volaterrae, aud who iusti-
9ated Chrysoyonus, uncler whose protection they were, to secure this
property ‚·for it was to the Roscii, and to them alone, that Chrysogonus
yave a share of the plunder.

[Consult the Index for Volaterrae]

ch.XXXV11.-2. ad Volaterras: the meaning of the proposition
is “ to the neighbourhood of Volaterrae,” not simply ‘⁴ to Volater-
rae.’' English idiom of course requires “in the neighbourhood of
Volaterrae.’' But the diffcrence here is very slight, as the phrase
is a mere variation of the Volaterras of 7, 19.

3. quadriduo . . . quo: see notes on 7, 18.

6. qui . . . rem: put last for e1nphasis; the relative of course
refers to Chrysogonus, not to eius. norat: noverat.

7. rem : ‘⁶ the facts of the case.'' qui: adverb, “ hoW.'’

9. cum audistis: “whenever you hear'' ; in a subordinate sen-
tence expressing a repeated action, when the principal verb is in the
present tense, the perfect tense is used in Latin, as the action of
the verb in the dependent clause is antecedent to that in the
principal clause (“you hear before you speak’'). The English
idiom is to use the present in such cases. audistis ι = audivistis.

12. quod : = ut ob id, the clause being consecutive. suspicionem:
“ a mere matter of suspicion‚” predicative accusative in agreement
with hoc, “ this fact,” the direct object of putetis. Suspicionem hoc
putetis is the reading of the MSS. ; the numerous “emendations”
of the various editors seem to be quite needless.

16. a maioribus: with haberent. patronos hospitesque: predi-
eative, multos veteres, “many old families‚'' being the direct object.
