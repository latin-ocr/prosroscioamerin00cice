01 Sulla: after the cessation of the war, in the midst 01
perfect tranquillity, he was murdered 111 Rome while return-
ing from dinner.1f he had been put to death legally, then
Ι admit that his property also was legally sold, but 11 it 1s
a well· known fact that he was murdered contrary, not only
to all ancient laws, but also to all those 01 modern times, Ι
ask by what right, or by what custom, or by what law his
property was put up for sale.

127. Do you ask about whom I am making these state·
ments, Erucius P It is not about him whom you wish and
believe it to be; for Sulla has been cleared from blame both

Roscius to have been a bad citizen, that he stated that he
had been killed while with the enemy, that he did not
allow Lucius Sulla to be informed 01 the facts by the

cleared u .

128. Nlow Ι believe there is stated in the law the date
by which proscriptions and sales of property are to be
made, namely the first 01 June : it was some months after-
wards that the man was murdered and his property is said
to have been put up for sale. In any case either this
property was not entered 111 the State accounts at all, and
we are more cleverly tricked by this scoundrel than we
think, or, if it was entered, the State accounts were tam-
pered with by some means; for it is an undisputed fact
that the property could not have been sold legally at any

rate. Ι know that I am making these inquirie em
turely, gentlemen, and almost going astray in DQ&

hang· nail when Ι ought to be looking after Sextus Roscius'
vital interests. For he does not trouble about his money;
he makes no account 01 his own interest3 he thinks he will
readily endure poverty, if he be freed from this shameful
