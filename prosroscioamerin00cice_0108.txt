100 excuso: pso Roscm. [cn. xxvnI.

20. †M. Metelle: quite unknown, since the praenomen is wanting
in the MSS. M. (for Marcus) is generally inserted, on the suppo-
sition that M. Metellus, praetor in 69 B.c.‚ is meant. vobis
advocatis ε see note on 1, 4. These influential men would be called
in when S. Roscius made his demand before the praetor M. Fannius.
agentibus : se. rem Roscii, “ when you were pleading his cause.’'

22. Τ. Roscium : sc. Magnum, from whom, as procurator or agent
of Chrysogonus, the slaves were demanded.

23. sectantur: i.e. as body-servants.

25. ut ex eis quaeratur : noun clause, object of postulo. quaeratur
is used impersonally.

31. in caede: “amid bloodshed‚'' as sicarii. ex caede: “by
bloodshed,⁷' as sectores.

35. erit: equivalent in sense to licebit esse ; “shall he not be
allowed to be ⁶? ”

36. quaeratur: subjunctive in final clause, since dum (“while’')
here denotes purpose (= “in order that meanwhile ³²).

39. diluissem: subjunctive in a dependent clause in oratio obliqua 3
it depends on the accusative and infinitive phrase, me dicturum
(sc. esse); the pluperfect represents the future perfect indicative
of direct speech.

XXIX, ἓξ 79-82. „memma—Roscius could not have employed
sreemen, because he never came to Rome, and the suyyestion that he
used slaves only turns suspicion upon yourselves. The argument that
chere were ab the time so many assassins abroad that murder could
easily be committed recoils upon the Roscii, who are themselves che
chiese and leaders of murderers.

Ch. XXIX-1. conveniat z jussive subjunctive in semi-dependence
on necesse esc, as in 27, 29. Cicero now recapitulates the dilemmas
of 27.

2. id. quod negas: = id quod probare non potes. Cicero is now
in a position to make this statement, since Erucius had not availed
himself of the permission given him (27, 6-8) to ask and answer
( uestions.

l 6. contra ostendo: an exaggeration, since Cicero nowhere estab-
lishes the alibi of S. Roscius.

9. temere z “ without good reason.’'

10. servorum nomen: = ut per servos saccum diceres 3 the sub-
stantive is preferred to the noun clause, because it is a better
antecedent for the relative adverbs quo and ubi, and also suits
porcum and scopulum. nomen: = locus, “the point,” “the mens
tion.'’

12. scopulum offendis: the nautical metaphor is continued;
offendere is regularly used for a ship striking upon a rock.

17. nullo negotio : ‘⁴ without any trouble.⁷'

18. potuisti: “you would have been able,'’ indicative instead of
potential subjunctive. See note on 19, 6.
